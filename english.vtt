You can go there to

16
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.400

Exceptional learner
from Grade 7 to Gred 9.

This is enough.

30
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.040
No need to ask the same whether
we will accept Lynn or not.

31
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.880
The problem is...

32
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.640
Do you want to study here?

33
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.480
What is your decision. dear?

34
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.800
I do not have to make a
decision right now. right?

35
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.360
I do not want to study here.

36
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.800
Actually. my old school
is more suitable for me.

37
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.680
If I move here. my dad...

38
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.640
... need to pay almost 150.000 a year.

39
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.360
Why 150.000?

40
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.920
One semester is only 60.000.

41
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.920
So it's all in 120.000.

42
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.619
Right.

43
00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.280
But my dad taught
in my old school.

44
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.440
So in the morning I
may go with him.

45
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.400
If I study here. I need
to board the Skytrain.

46
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.480
Includes the motortection of the
80 Bath Stores in each day.

47
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960
For 8 months. meaning 170 days.

48
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.840
Excluding school leave.

49
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.960
Everything in 13.600 Bath a year.

50
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.320

Only 20 Baths for two
side dishes with rice.

52
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.440
Here. it cost 35 Bath.

53
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.600
I also need to buy new school
equipment and uniforms.

54
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.440
I think it's all inclusive...

55
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.360
... he may not have bows.

56
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.880
Pingat gold in mathematics.

59
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.480
No. dad can not.

60
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.800
What if you learn it for free?

61
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.760
Vit. I will add a midday
meal program as well.

62
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.120
You see. our school does
judge Lynn's cleverness.

63
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.480
Now. do you think you're brazing?

64
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.680
Yes.

65
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.720
All of that is very brazen.

66

I am good at curriculum activities.

I am sure. others think
I'm less intelligent.

95
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.600
The attorney has already created a new rule.

96
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.920
To accompany the school drama.
I need at least GPA 3.25.

97

Why?

98
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.064
Am I too stupid to
play in a drama?

99
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.840
I think...

100
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.480
Tailors are worse off than learning.

101
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.840
Right?

102
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.080
Yes.

103
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.840
Look. I'm studying with
Encik Sophon for weeks.

104
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.400
But I still do not know anything.

105
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.360
And mathematics.
really blows gred me.

106
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.040
The answer is C.

107
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.518
What?

108
00:07:09.518 --> 00:07:11.151
You can answer by just looking?

109
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.960
In fact. in reverse!

110
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.480
That's easy very.

111
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.776
A and a united B that overlap with C.

112
00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:22.920
Complete the problem in confinement first.

113
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.640
So take a look at the
dwelling area in C.

114
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.440
So that's the answer.

115
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.720

3.87!

169
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.080
What about you?
How much can you get?

170
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.640
4.00.

171
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.800
Are you there tomorrow?
Let's get it.

172
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.320
Allow.
Where?

173
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.360
Let's see Pat.

174
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.160
Seronok sikit.

175
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.440
You have a bathing suit. right?

176
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.280
Pat. can not you
plunge as usual?

177
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.520
No.

178
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.760
Because he is not great.

179
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.760
Oops!
There is water in my ears.

180
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.080
Mr. Pat. dinner is served.

181
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.240
Leave it there.

182
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.440
Hey. I'm cool.

183
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.760
<i>Pat</i>

184
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.240
Grace. are you looking for rocks?

185
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.760
Many times I have told
Grace to pick you up here.

186
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.960
We are all in the same
class. but we rarely boast.

187
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.240
Grace is always good...

188
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.120
... Lynn it. this Lynn.

189
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.120
Be quiet.

190
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.080
Are you jealous?

191
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.240
Grace is always good. you are wise.

192
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.920
Without you. gred he
will not increase.

193
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.960
I also tell him...

194
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.320
I want a good friend like you.

195
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.520
I see you have a lot of friends.

196
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.880
Right.

197
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.320
But no one has given his
fire when borrowing.

198
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.840
So why?

199
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.760
Are you a school drama too?

200
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.680
A wise man like you
will not understand.

201
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.640
Less intelligent people like me...

202
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.240
... just put on a good gred.

203
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.840
Oops.

204
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.240
Hey!

205
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.640
If I do not fail. my dad
will give me a new train.

206
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.760
Seronok. right?

207
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.040
I know we are not so tight...

208
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.800
but if you agree...

209
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.120
I'll pay you 3.000 each subject.

210
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.640
From every one.

211
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.960
From every one?

212
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:56.920
Yes.

213
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.360
What do you mean?

214
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.880
I have five more people.

215
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.920
What if cikgu can know?

216
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.160
Do not worry about that chapter.

217
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.840
All my friends can be trusted.

218
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.880
Everyone is willing to pay.

219
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.600
Cuba think. that's
just one subject.

220
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.480
How many subjects are in a single semester?

221
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.080
Excluding subject of PE...

222
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.080
13?

223
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.720
So in one season of examination.
you will be able to...

224
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.800
13 times...

225
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.240
234.000 Bath.

226
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.800
Beautiful Digit. 234.000.

227
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.440
Just use your brain.

228
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720
Tick-tock.

229
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.920
Think of it as a school bribe.

230
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.520
What is money for a bribe?

231
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.840
Seriously?

232
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.920
You really do not know?

233
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.400
Everyone will pay.

234
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.760
The more stupid you are.
the more you need to pay.

235
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.880
I gave 400.000.

236
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.760
This stupid guy donates
20 iMacs for the library.

237
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.040
But I've got a scholarship.

238
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.240
The scholarship is for learning purposes.

239
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.480
Do not forget the
other boarding house.

240

<i>Divorce Letter</i>

242
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.120
What's so on you?

243
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.640
Dad will sell it
to buy a new cart.

244
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.680
You can not play anymore.

245
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.280
I just remembered my mother's
birthday last night.

246
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.200
Why did my father send
me to another school?

247
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.680
Most students from that school...

248
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.280
... got a scholarship
to study abroad.

249
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.640
Dad just give you
a better chance.

250
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.400
I am not like mother.

251
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.640
Have you ever thought that...

252
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.840
... i might be happier
in my old school?

253
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.720
Three eyes.

254

Do not be too strong and
annoying neighbor next door.

255
00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:06.344
Let's eat.

256
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.760
Daddy goes to sleep.

257
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.720
<i>Okay. I admit I paid Lynn.</i>

258
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.680
But pay him to learn piano.

259
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.480
Not in conflict with any
international law. right?

260
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880
Or is it wrong?

261
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.160
Did you take me to an
international tribunal?

262
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.720
You've heard that
classical music...

263
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.560
... can help brain development?

264
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.800
We will use 4 songs
to represent...

265
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.080
A. B. C and D.

266
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.960
Memorize the movement of my finger.

267
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.240
This is for A.

268
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.320
Remember. it starts with the little
finger and finishes with the thumb.

269
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.680
This is for B.

270
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.800
B is 4 3 2 1 3. repeating twice.

271
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.000
This is for C.

272
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.120
This is for D.

273
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.440
I will give 3 answers
in one time.

274
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.640
I will repeat this way.

275
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.960
So. he will not be suspicious.

276
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.760
This can be evasive
from cikgu attention.

277
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.240
Moreover. you complete yourself.

278
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.200
I will start giving
a reply at 9:15 am.

279
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.400
In the meantime. complete
the other questions first.

Expensive this outfit.

283
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.000
You get rich after
teaching the piano?

284
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.280
Dad needs to wear new clothes too.

285
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.640
They are harassing dad at school.
They are good fathers.

286
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.240
Dad no story if it
can be new as well.

287

<i>The classical piano by Mentor Lynn.</i>

288
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.960

Look forward to the
Genius Youth after this.

294
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.400
Me and Lynn are studying in the same school.

295
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.400
But we are not friends.

296
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.800
Actually. we are competitors.

297
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.200
What does not hit?

Hey!

Actually we will get
less than that.

306
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.080
With 3% excise tax
cut. it is 150.

307
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.080
So. only 4.850 or
2.425 every one.

308
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.560
That's still a lot.

I do not think.
I'm just memorizing it.

You memorize the value of Pi?

I always play memory
games with my dad.

The value of Pi. the person's name. the name of the river.

Good.

This school only
provided one slot only.

This road guess is
not from your set.

Do not let them know.

The chancellor may want to
talk to the student article...

We have evidence that Lynn is

Lynn.

467

Otherwise I'll throw you away.

... he is a mirror student.

But getting good gred
is not enough...

He needs good behavior.

477
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.600
You are a teacher. you are supposed to understand.

478
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.880
Answering your friend's
exam paper is a mistake.

479
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.760
It violates school rules.

480
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.960
I can throw you out now.

481
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.240
Although. this is
the first time...

482
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.360
... I can abort your students too.

Yes. master.

484
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.120
Can they take the original exam?

485
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840
Remember. Lynn.

486
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.920
School is the place to learn...

487
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.040
... not to make money.

488
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.800
What is a joke?

489
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.120
You are already brash.

490
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.240
Nothing.

491
00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.160
Encik Pravit...

492
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.640
You are a teacher.
You teach him a civilized way?

493
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.640
Sorry.

494
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.680
I do not think I'm just a...

495
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.400
... who uses the school
to make extra money.

496
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.720
What do you mean?

497
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.600
I am good at bribe
money my dad gave...

498
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.400
It's not a bribe.

499
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.200
That's the school.

500
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.120
Is not the school administration
included in the yuran?

501
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.280
Enough. Lynn!

502
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.200
I want to save the
teachings here.

503
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.520
He is still allowed to study in tuisyen.

504
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.320
Let's go.

505
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.440
All right.

506
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.960
But I have one condition.

507
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.080
You will not accept Singapore Student.

508
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.960
Okay.

509
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.040
Let's go.

510
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.960
What is the relationship of a student with this problem?

511
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.040
It is true that I let my
friends imitate me...

512
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.880
... but I never imitate anybody.

513
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.680
My gred results from
my own work and skill.

514
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.160
Other students also have this skill.

515
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.400
The person worthy of the
scholarship is Thanaphon.

516
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.160
If you can not accept
this situation...

517
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.840
... then you can withdraw.

518
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.200
All right. Encik Pravit?

519
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.160
Yes. master.

520
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.560
Let's go. Lynn.

521
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.960
Tahniah for the scholarship.

522
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.080
If you find evidence...

523
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.880
... I'm sure Lynn is dishonest.

524
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.880
But I have nothing to
do with that problem.

525
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.640
Being a respectable
student is not important.

526
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.240
We have the same behavior.

527
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.720
<i>Rinrada Nilthep</i>

528
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.040
Dad already a bit.
Not just 3.000 Bath.

529
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.320
Teaching piano?

530
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.840
Have you ever thought. actually
more beautiful teaching them?

531
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.520
But the deck cheats too.

532
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.360
How do you think it's deceiving?
Father paid willingly.

533
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.320
So do my friends!

534
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.120
You are still not conscious
with your mistakes!

535
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.440
Good.

536
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.280
Dad will accept that mistake.

537
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.760
It's all wrong father.

538
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.280
Dad should not blame others.

539
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.840
If your father can not afford to
raise you to be a good person...

540
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.640
... how dare dad ask anyone
else to pay your tuisyen?

541
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.120
Dad will sell the train
to pay your tuisyen.

542
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.000
For this dress...

543
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200
... dad no longer wants me.

544
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.200
About going out of the
country. forget it!

545
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.640
You're not going anywhere.

546
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.440
Stay here with my dad.

547
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.920
Return all the money
to your friends.

548
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.920
Do not think about the extent
of the ugliness you think...

549
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.400
but for me...

550
00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.800
... Lynn is really a good friend.

551
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.960
Sorry for crying.

552
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.880
But this is not intentional.

553
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.880
GRED 12

554
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.480
So?
Looks refreshing?

555
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.640
Hold it.

556
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.120
Selection of tomorrow starts.

557
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.120
You meet me not
just that. right?

558
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.080
How are you now?

559
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.440
You can face for the
coming semester?

560
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.440
Me and Pat have other
things to worry about.

561
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.520
Pat already told you?

562
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.520
We have just come back from France.

563
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.280
The visit was very hooked.

564
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.160
Yes. because mak left me.

565
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.440
It's a central area to buy.

566
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:33.960
Mak.

567
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.760
Mak have bought you something.

568
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:36.880
Pat.

569
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.600
Yes?

570
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.560
Go pick red wines for dad.

571
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.960
Why do not you ask
someone for help?

572
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.240
Good. sir.

573
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.200
Grace. you boys dessert again?

574
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.120
It's okay. thanks.

575
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.920
We picked you today...

576
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.800
... because we
want to thank you.

577
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.880
For what?

578
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.960
Because helps Pat in his lesson.

579
00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.440
You do not know...

580
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.120
... how depressed we
are to improve him.

581
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.280
But since Pat has
friends with you...

582
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.040
... he is very changed.

583
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:29.720
I think you are better than
all the teachers we know.

584
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.640
We have also designed...

585
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.920
... so Pat can study at the college
I studied first. in Boston.

586
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.520
But with grednya before this...

587
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.160
... I know he will not be able.

588
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.800
So. I reserve...

589
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.560
... so you should
also come with him.

590
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.360
So you can help him learn.

591
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.120
Likes?

592
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.840
Do not worry about shopping.

593
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.680
We will get...

594
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.320
... for recitation yuran.

595
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.400
If you need anything help...

596
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.000
Just let me know.
Do not worry.

597
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.280
I have some information for you.

598
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.240
Look at it.

599
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.240
If it's not a money
issue. just agree.

600
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.800
You know the STIC exam. right?

601
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.920
Just like a GAT / PAT exam. to
apply for a university in America.

602
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.880
The checks are made
simultaneously around the world.

603
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.600
I need to take STIC...

604
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.400
... and I need to
take it in this year.

605
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.200
If not...

606
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.760
I did not have time to apply for
that university in his time.

607
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.320
I've sacrificed a
lot for you. Grace.

608
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.680
I really did not have the
heart nak asked you...

609
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.880
... but we do not know
what else to make.

610
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.000
Pat said he would pay
you 600.000 Bath.

611
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.040
Can you return this to Pat?

612
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.040
Okay.

613
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.720
Can I borrow pens and papers?

614
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.320
<i>I really can not help you.
Sorry.</i>

615
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.720
Cik.

616
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.635
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hi. honey.

617

618
00:51:47.175 --> 00:51:48.551

619
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.897

620
00:51:51.897 --> 00:51:52.682
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now what time? </ font>

621
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.131
<font color = "# ffff00"> Noon. father. </ font>

625

<font color = "# ffff00"> It's now in bed here. </ font>

626

<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay. you need to sign in. </ font>

627
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.164
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay. can you contact me later? </ font>

628
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.088
<font color = "# ffff00"> Good evening. </ font>

629
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.002
<font color = "# ffff00"> Bye. </ font>

630
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.560
Zon period.

631
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.760
STIC taken following the same
period and date around the world.

632
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.920
So. these countries will
take the first check.

633
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.560
Let me explain.

634
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.560
If you both take
it in Thailand...

635
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.280
... so I need to go outside the
country and take a test somewhere.

636
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.560
For example. Sydney. Australia.

637
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.880
There. 4 hours earlier than Thailand.

638
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.360
I'll take that check first.

639
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.240
I'll finish it first.

640
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.320
I can take the answer
for both of you...

641
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.040
... and also the person who
accompanies us in Thailand.

642
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.640
Great.

643
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.720
You will not only get a mark...

644
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.240
... but we can make
money from others.

645
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.320
After all denied. we
will share the profits.

646
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.960
Is not that very risky?

647
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:54.920
What risks?

648
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.880
There is no risk whatsoever.

649
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.240
See who this is?

650
00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.720
Mentor Lynn.

651
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.560
This is the only way.

652
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.440
I can get enough money
to study with you...

653
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.880
... without asking for money from anyone.

654
00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.440
I forgot my son.

655
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.960
I will go Boston
with both of you.

656
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.160
It will be more hilarious
if we go together.

657
00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.360
Both of you will be
responsible for...

658
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.160
... look for this test taker.

659
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.840
For the part of checking...

660
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.960
... let me take care.

661
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:28.960
Later on.

662
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.960
Before we go looking for someone else...

663
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.320
I understand the article of the zon of that era...

664
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.480
but I'm still mistaken...

665
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.440
... how are you giving that answer?

666
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.320
Write?

667
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.400
By memorization.

668
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.000
The best way to remember it.

669
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.680
That's what survived the most.

670
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040
Without any paper.

671
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.680
Sorry.
You're one of the X-Men experts?

672
00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.960
STIC there are over 100 questions.

673
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.680
How do you remember all that?

674
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I can make.

675
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.080
If there is enough time.

676
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.560
The problem is after
I finish the exam...

677
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.760
... I do not have much time.

678
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.400
I can only remember
half of the answer.

679
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.320
Only half?

680
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.400
There is someone who may be allowed.

681
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.640
But maybe she does not want to.

682
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.040
Why. mak?

683
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.680
Yes. I'm done.

684
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.040
Home Cik Rut?

685
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:36.720
May it be another day?

686
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.600
Tomorrow...

687
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.440
... I have a student
check at 8:00 am.

688
00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.560
Okay.

689
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.600
Hey. you!

690
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.280
Your basket is rolling in my mirror!

691
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.480
If you are sorry...

692
00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.160
250.000 for the pass marker.

693
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:50.960
Small value for you. right?

694
00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.520
Yuran tutorial STIC more expensive.

695
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.920
We need it in 30 people.

696
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.600
If it's more than that.
it might be risky.

697
00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.680
If less than that. not berbaloi.

698
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.640
I can almost 30 people
in the STIC chat group.

699
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.560
If you can them all...

700
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.640
You will be able to...

701
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.640
... rejected from your full payment.

702
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.160
Later on.

703
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.840
You need to make sure no
one knows this chapter.

704
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.520
Especially the loser. Ben.

705
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.160
Do not ignore the bastard.

706
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.120
He will not be okay.

707
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.200
Why?

708
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.560
You do not hear?

709
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.280
He got knocked out.

710
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.960
Now he is hospitalized.

711
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.920
More sexy again...

712
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.800
... he is unfamiliar in
the scholarship check.

713
00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.120
<i>Seminar: Brilliant In
Education To Achieve Glory</i>

714
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.840
I am sure that you all come...

715
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.200
to pass STIC...

716
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.600
... for a brighter future.

717
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.560
He's Steve Pat.

718
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.400
I have a way to get a
satisfactory post.

719
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.080
The thing that needs to be brought
inside the checking chamber is...

720
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.800
Pensel 2B.

721
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:21.840
Fire Extinguisher.

722
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:23.880
Letter of endorsement.

723
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.040
Passport card.

724
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.680
Any kind of communication
tool is certainly not true.

725
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.680
So. I will hide this phone
to deliver the answer...

726
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.920
... in the tank.

727
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.600
I will conduct a response
during the break.

728
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.120
The examination is divided into 3 sessions...

729
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.600
... and 2 times break time.

730
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.640
Later on.

731
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.200
How do other people
remember all the answers?

732
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.040
Not everyone is
capable like you.

733
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.280
The bar code.

734
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.400
Everyone will receive a 2B
pen with a printed bar code.

735
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.000
The width on the bar code...

736
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.680
... will represent a reply.

737
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.920
Starts from left to right.

738
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.800
The thickest is A.

739
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.360
Then. B. C and D.

740
00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.640
Great. right?

741
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.200
But it does not end here.

742
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.760
There are 4 pens.

743
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.880
One pen for one part.

744
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.640
The number next to the bar
code for the Grid-In response.

745
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.400
For the section of the essay...

746
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.400
They usually take
published articles.

747
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.520
I'm going to deliver a keyword
to search for it on Google.

748
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.000
Hey. here I am.

749
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.960
Fall.

750
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.736
Hey. pay attention!

751
00:59:43.736 --> 00:59:46.064
You need to write an
essay by yourself.

752
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.240
In short. on the day
of the examination...

753
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.200
everyone will leave the
encounter before 7:30 am...

754
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.360
... to go to the examination
center just in time.

755
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.800
We will provide motosikal...

756
00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.640
... to take you to the
examination center.

757
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.000
End once...

758
01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.040
... everyone needs to
pay within 2 weeks.

759
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.240
Otherwise. the
agreement is canceled.

760
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.040
I also want to emphasize that...

761
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.760
... what makes this need to be taken care of.

762
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.560
Is there a problem?

763
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.160
If there is no...

764
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.360
I will end this seminar now.

765
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.720
We will unite together...

766
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.160
... to be brilliant in education.

767
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.440
We will be able to mark the location
we want to go to the university.

768
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.560
We may select a university.

769
01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.120
They can not choose us!

770
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.960
Ouch. the teruknya. Ben.

771
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.560
What is the news?

772
01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.600
I also sympathize...

773
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.800
... because you're off the scholarship.

774
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.720
Me too.

775
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.080
That day...

776
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.000
I did not intend.

777
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.680
I do not know whether you
are intentional or not.

778
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.160
What do I know...

779
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.920
... you need to be responsible
for what's going on.

780
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.200
I have a backup for you.

781
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.000
What is it?

782
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.440
Take a check.

783
01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.560
Taking or mimicking in a check?

784
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.640
For me. the words imitate it...

785
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.760
... means someone
will miss something.

786
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.080
But we will be able to earn money.
and others can be good marks.

787
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:08.880
So. all can.

788
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.720
Ben.

789
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.440
We are both equally poor.

790
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.600
We are not born rich
like Grace and Pat.

791
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.960
We must try harder to
achieve our dreams.

792
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.880
Look what happened?

793
01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.760
It's not the same.

794
01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.760
You're cheating.

795
01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200
I just have not had enough luck.

796
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.640
Right.

797
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.920
But you do not even though
you do not imitate...

798
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.680
... your life is still miserable.

799
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.320
This is the Grace address.

800
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.920
Meet tomorrow if
you're interested.

801
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.000
<i>Printing Warehouse</i>

802
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.680
<i>Printing Warehouse</i>

803
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.320
Sitting here.

804
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.520
You do not want to sit down?

805
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.200
Here's what we designed.

806
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.840
First.

807
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.720
We will go to Sydney and
take STIC together.

808
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.720
Hey. Lynn.

809
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.880
You have not enough documents.

810
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.840
Dad.

811
01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.680
Do you still remember the
Genius Youth program?

812
01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.360
They want me to go to Sydney.

813
01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.000
They need your bank's
regulator for Visa purposes.

814
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.240
Who are you going with?

815
01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.640
With Ben.

816
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.680
What?

817
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.960
Not just the two of us.
there is a teacher.

818
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.360
Second.

819
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.840
I and you...

820
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.840
... need to memorize half
the answer from every part.

821
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:55.960
Do not forget...

822
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.240
Ben will memorize
the first half...

823
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.360
... and Lynn. the second half.

824
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.680
Part 1 there are 52 questions.

825
01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:01.920
Start!

826
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.560
TROUBLE 1: 52 PROBLEMS

827
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.480
PART 2: 44 SOURCE

828
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.440
TROUBLE 3:16 GRID-IN PROBLEMS

829
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480
For the last part...

830
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.880
... you got to go first to
give me an essay question.

831
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.520
Period for section 4.
Start the essay.

832
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.360
Memorizing the keyword
is not so difficult.

833
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.280
But the hard thing is.
they will not let you go.

834
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.680
To evade suspicion...

835
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.600
... you need to act sick.

836
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:34.840
Allow.

837
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.960
I can vomit.

838
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.440
I need to vomit now?

839
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.640
Do not!

840
01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.800
How much do I pay?

841
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.320
1 million.

842
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760
How much do you pay?

843
01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.120
2 million.

844
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.640
What's your feeling. Ben?

845
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.800
Everything is in your hands.

846
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.000
Okay.

847
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.440
Can be!

848
01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.520
Exactly.

849
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.280
Yes!

850
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.240
You should call <i> yes </i> from the beginning.
British.

851
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.166
f a <font color = "# ffffff"> c e b </ font> o o k 1 <font color = "# ffffff"> 0 0 M a </ font> l a y

852
01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.600
Hey. come first!

853
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.080
Meet tomorrow. 1:00 noon.

854
01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.360
Are you crazy?

855
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.000
The flight was 11:00 pm.

856
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.160
Why hurry so much?

857
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.880
There is one more thing
we need to practice.

858
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.480
Enough.

859
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.880
You can not keep asking
innocent people!

860
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.200
You should be enjoying...

861
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.400
... cries of innocent people.

862
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.680
That's over. Pat.

863
01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.960
I use all my cards.

864
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.760
You make as you really
have been caught.

865
01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.040
I'm good. I understand...

866
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.240
... if you get arrested.
we'll just blame you.

867
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.040
Last question before
heading to the airfield.

868
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.160
Last question.

869
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.720
Spiritualizing character.

870
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.880
Willing?

871
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.400
What if Ben is caught?

872
01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.240
Are you going to be good?

873
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.520
He's a bit different.

874
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.160
I am not friends with him.

875
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.280
I see him around
school in 4-5 years.

876
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.920
I never saw he was a friend.

877
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.400
He looks like he is marginalized.

878
01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.400
The quaint.

879
01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.880
He was also beaten and dumped
into the stripping site.

880
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.160
Is it done?

881
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.280
Stop!

882
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.240
Already. Ben!

883
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.520
Already!

884
01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.360
I'm fine. stop!

885
01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.760
Stupid!

886
01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.520
Remove him!

887
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.720
What does not hit you?

888
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.080
You're the one who
told me so well.

889
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.920
So why are you angry with me?

890
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.840
Pat. already.

891
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.040
Ben...

892
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.520
Ben. that's enough.

893
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.120
Why?

894
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:28.800
Why?

895
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.600
I am...

896
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.360
What are you?

897
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.440
never...

898
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.840
... tell me what I have been
dumped at the removal site.

899
01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.160
Now you know what
angry I am for!

900
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.680
All of you are designing
all this. right?

901
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.240
You did this for me so I can
not get the scholarship!

902
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.440
You are all involved. right?

903
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.680
You all know it already. right?

904
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800
Really not?

905
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.800
You already know. right?

906
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.440
Why do not you answer?

907
01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.520
Ben. back then.

908
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560
Swimming. Ben.

909
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.160
I do not hear from you anymore!

910
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.640
Ben. be patient!
Let's talk!

911
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.000
Swimming.

912
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.240
Are you calm?

913
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.600
I'm sorry. Ben.

914
01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.120
I'm sorry.

915
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.240
I never thought they
were too harsh on you.

916
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.760
Ben. listen first.

917
01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.840
You still take STIC. right?

918
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.800
Forget the stupid STIC!

919
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.000
Ben. hear me first.

920
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.400
You. hear here!

921
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.320
I just got my mak.

922
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.000
He's old. still washing clothes!

923
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.720
You...

924
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.920
I'm not rich like you.

925
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.680
This scholarship is your dream.

926
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.080
A dream that can be nice to me.

927
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.440
You're a blast!

928
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.440
Ben. if I'm not Lulu STIC.
my dad will go berserk.

929
01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.000
Please. Ben.

930
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:56.760
Please.

931
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.040
We can both.

932
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.000
Please. Ben.

933
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.680
May be...

934
01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.000
You did it for your
father's birthday!

935
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.160
What's your problem?

936
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.040
Are not you a good
man you need him?

937
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.000
If I do not play dirty...

938
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.080
... do you think he's a kid please us?

939
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.280
Lynn.

940
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.560
Let's talk first.

941
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.080
You are also involved in this?

942
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.440
No. I do not know right away.

943
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.200
Try Pat's intentions Pat.

944
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.880
He made the cause...

945
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.400
... he's nak please design you.

946
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.000
No matter who gets hurt?

947
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.880
<i>The Future of Dobi</i>

948
01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.880
Grace. return everyone's money.

949
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.680
I pulled myself.

950
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.600
Wait. Lynn.

951
01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.200
Swimming.

952
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.600
Okay. I respect your decision.

953
01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.840
It's okay.

954
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.120
No need for anyone else.

955
01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.400
Only the three of us.
Like the original design.

956
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.360
You still do not understand?

957
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.760
If I'm okay. no boy!

958
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.880
All right.

959
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.200
Be on your back.

960
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.680
I have only one request.

961
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.440
Do not get mad at me.

962
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.280
If I have half of your brain...

963
01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.480
... I will not make
such a stupid case.

964
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.560
Please help.

965
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.000
Flight will be
released in 3 hours.

966
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.080
Let's go.

967
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:52.800
Ben.

968
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.480
I will continue.

969
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.840
At least. I can get paid.

970
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.240
I'm not spanked.

971
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.320
What if I'm good... ... I'm not doing this anymore?

972
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.000
I did not ask anyway.

973
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.880
Why did I come here because of you.

974
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.280
... you're the cause of me being
dumped at the removal site.

975
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.800
All these problems
are due to you.

976
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.640


977
01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.960
Are you guilty of
what you started?

978
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.960
SYDNEY

979
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.680
This is your call.

980
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.000
Lynn.

981
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.280
Yes?

982
01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.320
I'm sorry.

983
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.480
Sorry for what?

984
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.000
Because...

985
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.120
... your nose.

986
01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.520
Okay.

987
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.480
You know...

988
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.080
I've never been out of
the country before.

989
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.600
Start tomorrow and so on...

990
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.760
... the world is like our oyster.

991
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.640
Let's take a picture.

992
01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.080
LAST TESTS

993
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.321
<font color = "# ffff00"> <i> The STIC year of study is canceled in

1141
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.760
I already paid.

1142
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.520
Do not worry.

1143
01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.080
You will arrive at the time.

1144
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:31.960
I promise.

1145
01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.280
Pat!

1146
01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.280
We're out of sticker!

1147

Here it is.
500 every one.

1148
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.360
Swimming.
We'll leave later.

1153
01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.880
We have all the answers?

Not yet!
Six more!

1155

Why EDGE?

1156

What?

1157
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.120
This is EDGE!

1158
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.120
What is EDGE?

1159
01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.600
No cues.

1160
01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.480
What happens if we
do not have time?

1161
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.120
What about our money?

1162
01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.120
We will not have time!

1163
01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.520
We want money back!

1164
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.680
Hurry up.

1165
01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.680
You've got the answer. have not you?

Two of these. go to Suttisarn.

Everything has gone up?

1175

Students from Thailand claim to
use dictionaries from his phone.

We are working on this issue.

1191
01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.160
What will happen to him?

1192
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.600
Perhaps his checkpoint
will be canceled.

1193
01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.400
Most successful. he will be
blacklisted from retrieving STIC.

1194
01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:15.280
They will question you.
If nothing goes you can go.

1195
01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.360
Wait here first.

1196
01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.440
I will talk to them.

1197
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.040
Instant.

1198
01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.080
Why?

1199
01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:27.720


1200
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:34.520
Can I use demolition?

1201
01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.280
Allow.

1202
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.000
Lynn.

1203
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.600
Welcome back.

1204
01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.480
From Mentor Lynn's followers.

1205
01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.160
Thank you very much. Lynn.

1206
01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.840
We will hold a party
at my house tonight.

1207
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.800
For what?

1208
01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.960
You know. Ben got arrested?

1209
01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.000
And my markup has been canceled.

1210
01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.240
But...

1211
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.360
We'll find another
checkpoint for you.

1212
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.760
If you do not take
the first check...

1213
01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:36.040
... you can not apply to the university.

1214
01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.440
Hey. Lynn.
You got the initial check.

1215
01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.680
Please. Lynn.
Please.

1216
01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.600
I've changed my mind.

1217
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.640
Even though you've
got your markup.

1218
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.560
But...

1219
01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.760
We can not leave without you.

1220
01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.120
You both know no?

1221
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.160
Check out at university
no choice of answers.

1222
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.640
Even though I agree nak go...

1223
01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.840
... you still can not imitate me.

1224
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.440
I will seek my own future.

1225
01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.040
Where's your man's friend?

1226
01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.160
Where is he?

1227
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.880
Daddy nak pick him up for dinner.

1228
01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.480
What kind?

1229
01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.160
Why do not you ever
tell his chapters?

1230
01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:24.920
Dad...

1231
01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:25.880
Yes?

1232
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.680
I am a child for recognition.

1233
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.440
What is he. baby?

1234
01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.400
Tell the father.

1235
01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:52.360
Why are you interested in
the field of recitation?

1236
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.000
I want to be a
teacher like my dad.

1237
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.400
So others may benefit
from my knowledge.

1238
01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.139
You have experience in
giving instruction point...

1239
01:50:03.139 --> 01:50:04.864
... or teach others?

1240
01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:07.880
Yes. there is.

1241
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.400
<i>I got 1460 in STIC.</i>

1242
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:28.800
Becoming a teacher is not
just an academic expert.

1243
01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.000
You think...

1244
01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.200
You can be a good
example to others?

1245
01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:46.920
<i>Lynn. you come no?</i>

1246
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.360
<i>Ben has taken his share.
Let's take your part.</i>

1247
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.160
<i>I miss you.</i>

1248
01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.360
I am not a ruse.

1249
01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.840
Many bad things I
made before this.

1250
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.360
But I will make it a guideline
for myself and others.

1251
01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.560
<i>Lynn left the group chat.</i>

1252
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.960
To no avail.

1253
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.560
Many achievements you have accomplished.

1254
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.440
You may apply for a
student and study abroad.

1255
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.280
You are not interested in it all?

1256
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.280
I think...

1257
01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.680
... some are more deserving of it.

1258
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.080
<i>Student Dismissal Letter: Thanaphon Viriyakul</i>

1259
01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.880
<i>Ben: Come to my house tonight.</i>

1260
01:52:55.043 --> 01:52:58.113
<i>The Secretariat of Dobi Encik Ben</i>

1261
01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:19.400
Sign in.

1262
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.880
This shop looks new. Ben.

1263
01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:29.960
Silap.
Already Encik Ben now.

1264
01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.680
You are stolen wang haram?

1265
01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.480
You've been dumped school...

1266
01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:37.680
... because the embassy for
your chapter report. right?

1267
01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.360
Yes.

1268
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.000
After this. what is it?

1269
01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:47.720
That's why I invite
you to come here.

1270
01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.440
Have you applied for a GAT / PAT check?

1271
01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.640
I have a backup for you.

1272
01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.800
I have a way to trust.

1273
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360
Guaranteed to be safe.

1274
01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.400
We can give answer
to crowded people.

1275
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.960
More importantly. there are more
GAT / PAT takers from STIC.

1276
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:12.960
But this design...

1277
01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.280
... will not be complete without Mentor Lynn.

1278
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.160
How much money do you need?

1279
01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.920
If your payment is still not enough...

1280
01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.320
... you can take my
payment from Pat.

1281
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.240
Go take it.

1282
01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.440
No.

1283
01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.440
Instant.

1284
01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.560
This is not a chapter of money.

1285
01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.240
This article...

1286
01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:04.800
from now on...

1287
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.400
... how many we can make.

1288
01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.160
Lynn.

1289
01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.600
I've already made an estimate.

1290
01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.080
This time...

1291
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.760
... we may. at least 10 million.

1292
01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:23.040
You do not think it's enough
to blend with the risk?

1293
01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.280
You've been natural.

1294
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.720
If we are arrested. we
will not go to jail.

1295
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.080
Lynn.

1296
01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.280
Can you study for 4 years
with a 5-figure salary?

1297
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:42.560
You can get millions.
from now on.

1298
01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.960
Why do we need to
work at the desk?

1299
01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.840
Because for me...

1300
01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:00.160
... money is not everything.

1301
01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:10.160
Lynn.

1302
01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.520
If you do not want to make...

1303
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.377
I will tell everyone...

1304
01:56:17.377 --> 01:56:18.784
... that you are the
mastermind in STIC.

1305
01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:20.200
I assure you.

1306
01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.520
You will be black-acted from studying
outside the country like me.

1307
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:30.680
Let it be.

1308
01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.800
So. we're both in series.

1309
01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.400
Not just you!

1310
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.720
Grace.

1311
01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.480
Pat.

1312
01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:42.000
And all the STIC takers.

1313
01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.000
Fine carefully...

1314
01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320
If the boss can know...

1315
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.400
... they may abort all
markers within Thailand.

1316
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.160
One more thing...

1317
01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.360
Your father should be
disappointed with you.

1318
01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.640
Do not be afraid. honey.

1319
01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.240
We must continue. no
matter what happens.

1320
01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.240
Smile.

1321
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.840
Dad's kind smile.

1322

1323
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.800
You ever told me...

1324
01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:41.040
If we win. we win together.

1325
01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.760
If we lose. we lose equally.

1326
01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.560
I'm not the type who likes
to feel it all by myself.

1327
01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:49.800
If you do not want to make...

1328
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.360
I will make sure you
will fall with me!

1329
01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:00.920
Do you think. Lynn?

1330
01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.480
What will apply?

1331
01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:08.800
It all depends on you.

1332
01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:16.400
That's right.

1333
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.960
Everything depends on me.

1334
