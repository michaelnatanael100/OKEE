Michael Movie

1
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:55,999

2
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,580
Now, let's talk about the STIC test

3
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,120
or Standardized Test for
International Colleges,

4
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,290
which tests for general
knowledge and

5
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,820
it is used to apply to bachelor
programs in the U.S.

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,460
This year the association
overseeing the examination

7
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,660
has uncovered a
cheating scandal,

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,470
which has led to the exam leaking in
in various countries in Asia.

9
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,740
Further investigation
is pending...

10
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,890

11
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,990
My name is Rinrada Nilthep.

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,790
I'm in Grade 12, class 3

13
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,830
at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,400
You can call to check
my school records.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,540
The STIC exam isn't
beyond my ability.

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,200
BAD GENIUS

17
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,940
Student Portfolio:
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,440
This student has achieved a 4.00 GPA
in Grade 7, Academic Year 2011

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,710
GRADE 9

20
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,650
Straight A's since Grade 1.

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,820
Honor student since
Grade 7 to Grade 9.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,590
Came in first place in the school
district's Maths Competition.

23
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,630
National Crossword Champion.

24
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,430
There's also achievements in sports...

25
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,960
this one is...

26
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,200
For swimming.

27
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,630
That's fine, Vit.

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,570
This is more than enough.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,340
No need to ask whether we
would accept Lynn or not.

30
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,310
The important question is...

31
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,080
do you want to study here?

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,480
What do you say, honey?

33
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,650
I don't have to
decide now, right?

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,460
It's not that I don't
want to study here.

35
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,860
It's just that my old school
is more suitable for me.

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,800
If I move here, my Dad

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,200
will have to pay 150,000 per year.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,040
How is it 150,000?

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,500
One semester is only 60,000,

40
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,840
so it only comes up to 120,000.

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Correct. However, my Dad
taught at my old school,

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,720
So I can go with him to
school every morning.

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,650
If I study here, I'd have
to take the skytrain

44
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,190
including calling motortaxis from the
station to home is 80 baht everyday...

45
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,630
for 8 months, which is 170 days,

46
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,230
excluding holidays.

47
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,870
It's approximately
13,600 baht per year.

48
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,540
There's also lunch,

49
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,710
At my old school it only
costs 20 baht for 2 sides with rice.

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,410
Here it's 35 baht.

51
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,680
I'll also have to buy new
school supplies and uniforms.

52
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,750
I think all in all...

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,980
it might not be worth it.

54
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,730
Gold medal in maths.

55
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,730
Honey...

56
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,100
I can afford it.

57
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,330
No, you can't.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,030
What if we let you study for free?

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,480
Vit, I'll add free
lunch as well, okay?

60
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,950
We want you to see that
we value geniuses like Lynn.

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,280
Is it worth it now?

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,490
Worth it.

63
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,790
Worth bringing all this.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,860
It's worth it, right?

65
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,400
Letter of Authorization

66
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,530
Lynn

67
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,340
GRADE 10

68
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,540
Alright, done.

69
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,610
One second!

70
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,780
This ID is gonna be
with us for 3 years.
71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,980
You gotta look good.

72
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,620
Okay?

73
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,930
You just moved here, right?

74
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,290
I'm Grace.

75
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,490
I'm Lynn.

76
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,570
What are you doing?

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,940
Can I have a look?

78
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,500
Take off your glasses.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,540
Trust me.

80
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,410
Wow!

81
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,350
Pretty!

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,380
Smile. C'mon.

83
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,590
Okay. Ready 1... 2.

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
Go.

85
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,060
You're next. Quickly.

86
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,500
Grace

87
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,750
My ID number is after hers, so
we sat next to each other for 3 years.

88
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,750
Actually, Lynn and I are really close.

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,550
But everyone says Lynn's a genius.
But I'm...

90
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm good at extracurricular
activities.

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,030
Sometimes, people might
even call me stupid.

92
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,200
The Headmistress came
up with a new policy this semester.

93
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,980
To be in a school play, you
need at least a 3.25 GPA.

94
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,110
Why? Am I too stupid
to be in a school play?

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I think...

96
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,890
acting is harder than studying.

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,090
Really?

98
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,320
Really.

99
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,300
Look, I've been tutoring
with Mr. Sophon for weeks,

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,170
but I still don't know shit.

101
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,370
And maths really pulls
my grades down.

102
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,040
The answer is C.

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,010
What! You got the answer
just by glancing?

104
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,980
Upside down, too!

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,680
It's super easy.

106
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,290
"A union B, intersect with C."
Do the one's in the parentheses first,

107
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,960
then "intersect with C"
is just whatever's left in C.

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,290
That's the answer.

109
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,730
Oh! I get it.

110
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,200
Scholarship kids really are smart.

111
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,170
Another one?

112
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,380
Lynn, will you be my tutor?

113
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,650
Why not?

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,450
If you teach me,

115
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,420
I'll buy you a milkshake
after school every day.

116
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,290
Nah.

117
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,320
You'll get to review the
lesson every evening.

118
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
Not enough.

119
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,790
What about...

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,660
If you agree,

121
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,070
I'll get to be your first
student, Mentor Lynn.

122
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,410
Mentor Lynn.

123
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,540
Mentor Lynn.

124
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,410
Mentor Lynn!

125
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,950
That got me.

126
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,320
I'll teach you all
of this today.

127
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,550
Grace told you I helped
with her studies?

128
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,660
That's right.

129
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,460
But tutoring my friend
isn't wrong, right?

130
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,330
MIDTERMS

131
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,170
It's the moment you've
been waiting for.

132
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,370
Pass the test paper.

133
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,210
That's enough. Take a deep
breath, clear your mind.

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,210
It's already crystal clear.

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,120
Students, you may
start the exam.

136
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,790
Maths60 questions / 30 marks

137
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,630
Mathematics...

138
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,730
I've warned you before,
it's not that easy.

139
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,400
If you know you don't understand

140
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
and you still didn't
come tutor with me then.

141
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,010
Don't come to me now.

142
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,710
It's too late.

143
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,820
Grace.

144
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,420
The paper is exactly
the same as Mr. Sophon's sheets!

145
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,650
- Yeah!
- You can do it, right?

146
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,660
No.

147
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,320
Why not? I already taught you!

148
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,630
I can't remember.

149
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,730
No talking, no cheating!

151
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,670
I will not tolerate any
misconduct in my exam room.

152
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:36,990
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

153
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,490
Grace.

154
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,830
(INAUDIBLE) Answers.

155
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,330
Do I have to write my name
on the scrap paper?

156
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,660
Of course!

157
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,130
Have you never taken a test?

158
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,500
Sorry, sir.

159
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,160
Student Report Card

160
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,200
3.87! 3.87! 3.87!

161
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,340
What did you get? What did you get?

162
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,980
4.0, no sweat.

163
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,350
Are you free tomorrow?
Let's celebrate.

164
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,810
Sure. Where?

165
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
Let's got to Pat's then.

166
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,580
It's convenient.

167
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,290
You have a swimsuit, right?

168
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,540
Pat, will it kill you to
just get in pool like a normal person?

169
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,840
Nope...

170
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,110
but it's not cool.

171
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,370
I got water in my ear.

172
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,580
Mr. Pat, dinner is served.

173
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Just leave it.

174
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,550
Babe, I'm cold.

175
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,790
Pat

176
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Are you coral watching, Grace?

177
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,510
To be honest, I've told Grace to invite
you over to my place a bunch of times.

178
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,840
We're all in the same class,
but we hardly ever talk.

179
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,840
But Grace though,

180
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,710
always Lynn this... Lynn that.

181
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,910
Shut up.

182
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,410
Are you jealous?

183
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,490
Grace says that you're
good at everything.

184
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,560
Without you, her grades
wouldn't have improved.

185
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,490
I even told her that...

186
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,130
I want to have a
friend like you.

187
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,360
I've seen you with
a bunch of friends.

188
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,630
You're right,

189
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,540
but no one lends me their
eraser during exams.

190
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,110
Why?

191
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,550
Why? You want to be in
the school play as well?

192
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,550
Smart people like you
don't understand.

193
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,460
Idiots like me,

194
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,160
we all want good grades.

195
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,690
Damn.

196
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,330
Hey, babe!

197
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,030
Dad said if I don't fail this semester
he'll will get me a new car.

198
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
Sounds good?

199
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,610
I know that we aren't tight...

200
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,410
but if you agree...

201
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,980
I'll pay you 3,000 per subject.

202
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,550
This is per person.

203
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,890
Per person?

204
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah.

205
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,590
What do you mean?

206
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,030
I've got 5 more friends.

207
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,360
What if the teachers find out?

208
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,360
Don't worry about that.

209
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,470
All my friends can be trusted.

210
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,570
And all my friends are willing to pay.

211
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,440
Think about it, this
is only one subject.

212
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,410
And each semester has...
how many subjects, Grace?

213
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,880
Not including PE...

214
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,910
13, right?

215
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,450
So each semester,
you'll get...

216
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,680
13 times...

217
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,620
234,000 baht.

218
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,520
Nice digits as well: 234,000.

219
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,330
In exchange for your brains.

220
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,500
Tick-tock.

221
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,170
Call it even for the
school's 'tea money'.

222
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,570
What tea money?

223
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,610
Seriously?

224
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,270
You really don't know?

225
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,440
Everyone pays.

226
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,980
The stupider you are,
the more you pay.

227
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,050
I paid 400,000.

228
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,050
And this dumbass donated 20
iMac's to the library.

229
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,790
But I got a scholarship.

230
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,060
The scholarship is for studying.

231
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,460
Don't forget about
the maintenance fees.

232
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,110
Receipt:
New Student Fee - 200,000 baht

233
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,500
Divorce Papers

234
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,030
What mood are you in?

235
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,670
You know, I was going to sell
it to buy a new car.

236
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,700
Since you never play it anymore.

237
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,640
I just remembered yesterday
was Mom's birthday.

238
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,160
Why did you want me to
move to this school so much?

239
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,190
Most students from this school

240
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,160
get scholarships
to study abroad.

241
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,800
I wanted to give you
opportunities your old school couldn't offer.

242
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,540
I'm not like Mom, you know.

243
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,900
Have you ever thought that

244
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,440
I might be happier
at my old school?

245
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,550
Three points.

246
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,190
Don't be too loud and disturb
the neighbors. Eat dinner.

247
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm going to bed.

248
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,420
Okay, I admit I paid Lynn.

249
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,730
But paying her for
piano lessons...

250
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,530
isn't against any laws, right?

251
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,130
Or is it?

252
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Will you send me to
international court?

253
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,210
Have you ever heard
that classical music

254
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,540
helps with the
brain's development?

255
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,440
We'll use 4 songs
to represent

256
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,920
A, B, C and D.

257
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,290
Memorize my right hand movements.

258
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,690
This is A.

259
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,630
Remember that it starts with the pinky
and finishes with the thumb.

260
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,870
This is B.

261
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,670
B is 4 3 2 1 3, repeated twice.

262
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,040
This is C.

263
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,150
This one D.

264
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,420
I'll give you 3
answers and skip 1.

265
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,920
I'll repeat this pattern.

266
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,950
So that the scores are scattered.

267
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,990
This'll keep the marks in check,
and not alert any teachers.

268
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,930
You must complete every question
that is the multiple of 4.

269
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,030
I'll start giving the
answers at 9:15 a.m.

270
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,840
Meanwhile, complete the
remaining questions.

271
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
D.

272
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,450
Lynn.

273
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,590
This shirt is expensive.

274
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,290
Are you getting rich from
teaching piano?

275
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,360
You can wear new
clothes too, you know.

276
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,200
They tease you at school
that you're a scrooge.

277
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,800
I wouldn't mind a new
pair of trousers too.

278
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,740
"Classical Piano Lessons
by Mentor Lynn"

279
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,280
More people want to
join your piano class.

280
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:02,030
Congratulations to Scholarship
Students, Academic Year 2013

281
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,510
GRADE 11

282
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,450
Bank

283
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,090
Stay tuned for Teen Genius
after the break!

284
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
It's true that Lynn and I study at
the same school.

285
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,540
But we're not friends.

286
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,600
Actually, we're rivalries.

287
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,110
What's wrong, Bank?
Are you nervous?

288
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
Uh-huh.

289
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,210
Did you have noodles for lunch?

290
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,150
How'd you know?

291
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,550
You've got some on your shirt.

292
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,090
Dirty and wrinkled.

293
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,160
Here. A wet wipe.

294
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,630
For your shirt.

295
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,110
Hey! If we win we'd get 5,000 baht!

296
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,980
We'll actually get
less than that.

297
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,780
With 3% tax deduction:
which is 150.

298
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,150
So it's only 4,850
or 2,425 each.

299
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,680
It's still a lot.

300
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,490
It's enough for a salmon buffet.

301
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,690
If we win, you wanna
go this evening?

302
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,700
No.

303
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,370
I don't like eating outside.

304
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,440
It's a waste of money.

305
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,010
What are you laughing at?

306
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,610
Nothing. You sound
just like my Dad.

307
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,280
Is that good or bad?

308
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,150
Of course, It's a good thing.

309
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,420
Messy hair, wrinkled
shirt. Exactly like him.

310
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,520
What? I'm just gonna
fix your hair.

311
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,290
We're going on TV, the least
you can do is look good.

312
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,070
Looking handsome.

313
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,970
Ready?

314
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,380
Hmm.

315
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,650
Final question.

316
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,730
Tell me the Pi value with as many
decimal places as possible.

317
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,100
3.141592653589793...

318
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
That's enough, that's enough!

319
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,200
And the winner of this
week's Teen Genius is...

320
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,870
Krungthep Thaweepanya School!

321
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,550
I'm really awestruck. How did
divide the Pi value so quickly?

322
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,480
I didn't divide it.
I just memorized it.

323
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,050
You memorized the value of Pi?

324
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,660
I used to play memory
games with my Dad.

325
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,660
Pi's value, names of
people, and reservoir names.

326
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,900
Brilliant, this is why you're
our scholarship student.

327
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,530
Have a seat.

328
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,940
I didn't ask you to come
only to praise you.

329
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,410
I also have good news for you.

330
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,650
Next year, the Singaporean Embassy
is offering scholarships for Thai students.

331
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,450
No strings attached.
It's a full scholarship.

332
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,090
You can study a bachelors and
finish with a doctorate.

333
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,460
Considering your grades,
behavior and determination,

334
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,160
There's only you two who are
the school's best representatives.

335
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,800
There's a catch though.

336
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,610
Each school can only send one
student for the scholarship.

337
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,670
But that shouldn't
be a problem, right?

338
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,480
Yesterday, you two
were teammates.

339
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,480
But from now on, you're now rivals.
Isn't this fun?

340
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,410
Little Bank Laundry Service

341
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,140
The washing machine broke again.

342
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,850
I can't finish the
laundry in time.

343
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,530
Don't worry. I'll
take care of it.

344
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,730
Your hands are all calloused.

345
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,050
It's understandable
if you think I cheated...

346
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,620
but thinking that Bank
would cheat too?

347
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,490
Aside from my father,

348
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,360
Bank is the only other honest
and hard-working person

349
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,700
I've ever known in my entire life.

350
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,830
Hey, Bank!

351
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,440
What's up, Tong?

352
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,100
Did you finish studying for the exam?

353
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,210
Me too, man.

354
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,680
I was sick and didn't
finish studying.

355
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,240
Exactly the same,

356
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,280
Go finish studying.

357
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,880
Dude, please help me!

358
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,820
Let me copy you.

359
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,190
I really can't fail this time.

360
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,130
I've tried...

361
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,830
but this piano code is
just too hard for me.

362
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,200
What piano code?

363
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,340
Oh-- No--
It's nothing.

364
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,680
Hey, I won't copy you for free.

365
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,050
I'll pay you.

366
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,380
3,000 baht, enough?

367
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,350
Letting me copy
won't lower your marks.

368
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,990
Wait! Listen to me!

369
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,960
Bank!

370
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,090
Bank!

371
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,190
Bank!

372
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
Bank!

373
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,630
Damn it, Bank! Can't
you help a friend?

374
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,730
You're goddamn heartless!

375
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,200
Hurry, hurry.

376
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,540
Today you're all taking
the test together.

377
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,540
Don't sit next to
your classmates.

378
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,290
All right, you may
start your test.

379
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,730
Grade 11, class 1

380
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,460
Grade 11, class 4

381
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,730
Grade 11, class 3

382
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,460
Grade 11, class 6

383
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,080
40. Your exam paper is set 1.

384
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,860
Sir, how do we
answer question 40?

385
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,690
There are two sets
of test papers.

386
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,600
Just answer according
to the one you have.

387
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,840
A. Set 1

388
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,110
B. Set 2

389
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,130
Be careful of Tong copying.

390
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,940
Lynn! Which set did you get?

391
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,420
So, which set?

392
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,490
Set 1.

393
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,830
Leave set 1 here.

394
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,170
What?

395
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,170
Row 3.

396
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,740
Banjong.

397
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,510
Crew cut with glasses.

398
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,610
He's copying Rinrada, she's
sitting next to him.

399
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,920
I'll take care of it.

400
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,820
Don't worry.

401
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,080
You can go.

402
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,590
What now?

403
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,330
30 minutes left.

404
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,000
A. Set 1

405
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,560
Tong.

406
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,660
Huh?

407
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,130
Switch the papers.

408
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,200
Now!

409
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,000
Banjong Wongpoom

410
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,680
20 minutes left.

411
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,810
Lynn. Lynn.

412
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,650
What?!

413
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,080
Should I erase your name
and write mine instead?

414
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,820
No! Just sit still.

415
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,370
10 minutes left.

416
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,700
Last 5 minutes.

417
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,180
B. Set 2

418
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,680
Time's up.

419
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,750
Stop writing!

420
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,760
Hey!

421
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,620
Put your pencils down!

422
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,700
That's enough!

423
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,750
Don't you already have enough A's?
That's it!

424
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,450
[Jeez, the teacher's playing hardball.]

425
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,560
[That was close. Thank you, Mentor Lynn]

426
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Is it worth it?
Being this risky.

427
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,330
Well, it is 3,000 for 25 per person.

428
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,130
What do you think?

429
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,340
Rinrada!

430
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,870
You didn't write your
name on the scrap paper.

431
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,450
Rinrada, Grade 11, class 3

432
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,250
and Banjong Grade 11, class 1,

433
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,950
report to the Headmistress's
office immediately.

434
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,290
I assure you.

435
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,590
If you don't believe me, then
have Tong retake the test.

436
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,390
You'll know the truth.

437
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,730
I've called the
both of you in...

438
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,410
because Thanaphon said
there's been some cheating.

439
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,040
There are 2 sets of test papers.
There's no point of cheating.

440
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm giving you a chance
to tell the truth.

441
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,900
Banjong, did you cheat?

442
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,610
We'll find out soon enough.

443
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,450
Thanaphon and Rinrada,
you're excused.

444
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,420
Banjong, you stay here.

445
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,990
Lynn, don't leave yet.

446
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,130
How did you do these problems
on your scrap paper?

447
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,210
Since these problems are
not on the set you got.

448
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,820
Please don't get caught us.

449
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,530
Don't worry about it,

450
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,330
The Headmistress probably wants
to discuss about the scholar--

451
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,710
We have evidence that

452
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,880
Lynn completed her
friend's paper.

453
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,420
Lynn.

454
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,590
Explain why you did it.

455
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,860
If you don't, then
I will expel you.

456
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,860
For the money.

457
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,500
Tong tried to hire
me to do his test.

458
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,940
3,000 baht.

459
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,550
I'm very disappointed in you.

460
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,750
Vit...

461
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
I accepted your
daughter because

462
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,550
she's an honor student.

463
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,420
But it's not just about
being an good student,

464
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,190
it's also about having good discipline.

465
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,400
You're a teacher, you
should understand.

466
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,730
Completing your friend's
exam paper is cheating.

467
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,930
It's a gross violation
of school policy.

468
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,370
To be honest,
I could expel you right now.

469
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,740
Seeing that this
is your first time,

470
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,980
I'll just cancel
your scholarship.

471
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,150
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,500
To be honest, having Tong and Lynn
retake the test should be enough...

473
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,400
Remember Lynn.

474
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,670
School is a place for studying,

475
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,770
not a place for making money.

476
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,680
What are you laughing at?

477
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,080
Where are your manners?

478
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,210
Nothing.

479
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,210
Mr. Pravit,

480
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,780
you're a teacher, didn't
you teach her manners?

481
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:53,990
Sorry.

482
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,990
I don't think I'm the only one

483
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,990
who uses the school
to make money.

484
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,300
What do you mean?

485
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,570
I'm talking about the
'tea money' that my Dad paid.

486
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,540
It's not called 'tea money'.

487
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,210
It's the school maintenance fee.

488
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Isn't school maintenance fee
included in the tuition fee?

489
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,580
Stop, Lynn!
That's enough.

490
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,030
Please let her study here.

491
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,230
I'll take care of the
remaining tuition.

492
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,330
Let's go.

493
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Fine.

494
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,130
I have one condition.

495
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,510
You're banned from the
Singapore Scholarship.

496
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,820
Okay, okay.

497
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,950
Let's go.

498
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,750
What's the scholarship
have to do with it?

499
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,120
It's true that I let
my friend copy me,

500
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,020
but I've never copied anyone.

501
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,800
All the grades that I've gotten
reflect my actual abilities.

502
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,630
These abilities,
other students have them too.

503
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,000
There's also people who deserve
this scholarship like Thanaphon.

504
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,910
If you can't accept
this condition,

505
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,670
then you can resign.

506
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,110
All right, Mr. Pravit?

507
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,380
Yes, ma'am.

508
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,920
Let's go, Lynn.

509
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,420
Good luck with the scholarship.

510
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,940
Well, if you found evidence...

511
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,480
I guess Lynn really did cheat.

512
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,550
But I have nothing
to do with it.

513
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,320
Being an honor student
doesn't mean...

514
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,090
we have the same behavior.

515
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,630
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

516
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,660
I knew it.

517
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,370
I knew you didn't do it just for 3,000 baht.

518
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,840
Piano lessons?

519
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,780
Did you ever think that it'd
actually be better to actually tutor them?

520
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,450
But the Headmistress
cheated us first.

521
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,190
How can you call it cheating,
when I paid willingly.

522
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,190
My friends also paid willingly!

523
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,330
Can't you see you did wrong?!

524
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,410
Ok.

525
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,140
I'll take the blame.

526
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,780
It's my fault.

527
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,450
Who am I to blame?

528
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,190
If I can't raise my daughter
to be a good person,

529
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:18,160
then why should I go ask for
scholarships for my daughter?

530
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,100
I'll sell the car to pay for
the rest of the tuition fee.

531
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,170
As for this shirt...

532
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,550
I don't want it anymore.

533
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,750
About going abroad,
just forget it!

534
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,320
You're not going anywhere.

535
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,420
You're staying here with me.

536
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,130
Return all the money to your
friends by the end of the semester.

537
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,780
You can think that
Lynn is a bad person,

538
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,420
but to me...

539
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,860
she's truly a good friend.

540
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,700
Sorry for being such a crybaby,

541
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,670
but I'm not just acting.

542
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,880
GRADE 12

543
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,920
So? Does it look refreshing?

544
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,160
Not bad.

545
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,730
I'm casting is tomorrow.

546
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,830
You didn't call me just
for this, right?

547
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,040
How are you guys getting along?

548
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,540
You can take care of yourselves
for last two semesters, right?

549
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,780
Pat and I have other
things to worry about.

550
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,050
Has Pat told you, yet?

551
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,190
We just got back from France.

552
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,820
The trip was so fun!

553
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,030
Yeah, 'cause you left your son behind.

554
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,630
Well, I've got to go shopping too.

555
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,130
- Mom.
- I got you something too.

556
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,730
- Pat.
- Yes?

557
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,730
Go fetch a red wine
in the cellar for me.

558
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,340
Why don't you ask
the housekeeper to do it?

559
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,910
Yes, sir.

560
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,020
Grace, would you like
any more dessert?

561
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,290
No, thank you.

562
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,960
We invited you over today

563
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,160
because we would
like to thank you.

564
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,370
Thank me for what?

565
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,540
For helping Pat
with his studies.

566
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,100
You have no idea...

567
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,910
how disappointed we've
been over his grades.

568
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,210
But ever since Pat's
been seeing you,

569
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,080
he's like a totally
different person.

570
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:33,050
I think you're better than
all those famous tutors.

571
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,030
To be honest, we've
been planning this for some time.

572
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,730
We wanted Pat to study at the
same university as I did, at Boston.

573
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,540
But looking at his previous grades...

574
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,340
I knew he wouldn't make it.

575
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,040
So, I thought that...

576
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,910
you should go with him.

577
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,780
So you can help him study there.

578
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,650
Sounds good, right?

579
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,970
Don't worry about the expenses.

580
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,030
Share the living expenses with Pat.

581
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,670
As for tuition fees...

582
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,870
if you need any help...

583
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,780
you can let us know. Anytime.

584
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,080
I've some information
for you already.

585
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,120
You can take a look at it.

586
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,490
If money isn't an issue,
say yes, all right?

587
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,540
You know of the
STIC test, right?

588
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,540
It's like GAT/PAT, used to
apply to American universities.

589
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,580
It's the same test
at the same time, worldwide.

590
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,610
I need to take the STIC...

591
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,550
and I need to take
it within this year.

592
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,450
If not...

593
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:15,160
I won't be able to apply
to the university in time.

594
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,060
I've already been
busted once, Grace.

595
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,770
I'm not comfortable
asking you for help either

596
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,110
but we really don't
know what to do.

597
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,480
But Pat said he'll pay
you 600,000 baht.

598
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,200
Could you return this to Pat?

599
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,500
Yes, alright.

600
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,300
Could I borrow a pen
and some paper as well?

601
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,140
"I really can't help you guys this time. Sorry!!"

602
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,750
Miss.

603
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,960
- Hi baby, I'm so glad that you called.
- Hi Dad.

604
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,300
It's so bright there.
What time is it?

605
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,830
It's noon, Dad.

606
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,640
I hope you have a lot
of fun in Thailand!

607
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,710
Can you see what's time
it is here? Can you see?

608
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,210
Why it's so dark there?

609
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,610
It's nap time here.

610
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,480
Okay. I've got to check in.

611
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,450
Okay. Can I call you back later?

612
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,550
Good night.

613
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,680
Bye-bye.

614
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,370
Time zones.

615
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,610
The STIC is taken at the same
time and date worldwide.

616
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,950
This means countries here will take
the test earlier than the rest.

617
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,750
Simply,

618
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,590
If you two take it in Thailand

619
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,650
while I fly over and take
the test somewhere earlier.

620
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,790
Like Sydney, Australia.

621
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,460
4 hours ahead of Thailand.

622
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,990
I will get to see
the exam first.

623
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,960
Complete it first.

624
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,900
And send you guys the answers,

625
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,800
along with the others taking the test in
Thailand. As many people as we want.

626
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,740
Oh my God.

627
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:59,080
Not only will you get
enough to pass for university,

628
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,720
but we can also get more money
from other clients.

629
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,950
After deducting the costs,
we'll split the profits.

630
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,720
Is it too risky?

631
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,790
What risk?
It's not risky at all.

632
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:13,960
Who is this?

633
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,730
This is Mentor Lynn.

634
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,660
This is the only way

635
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,430
that I can earn enough
money to go study with you

636
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,170
without asking anyone.

637
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,170
Oh, I forgot to mention...

638
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm going to Boston
with you guys.

639
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,980
Going together will
be so much fun!

640
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,320
The job for you two is
just to find clients for us.

641
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,190
As for the exam,
I'll take care of it.

642
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,290
Wait.

643
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,400
Before we go looking
for clients,

644
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,830
Now that I understand this
time zone thing,

645
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,830
but I'm still confused as to

646
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,100
how the hell are you
gonna give us the answers?

647
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,070
Write them down?

648
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,270
Memorize them.

649
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,050
The best way is to memorize it.

650
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,780
It's the safest way

651
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,180
and it leaves no trail.

652
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,750
Sorry. Are you part of the X-Men?

653
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,420
The STIC has over 100 questions.

654
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,160
Are you gonna remember all that?

655
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,430
I can.

656
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,690
If there's enough time.

657
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,060
The problem now is that
after I finish the test...

658
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,570
there's only so much time.

659
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:29,100
The most I can remember
half of all the answers.

660
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,370
Only half?

661
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,570
There's only one person
who can help.

662
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,910
But he wouldn't do it.

663
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,750
What's up, Mom?

664
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,460
I'm done.

665
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,990
Mrs. Rut's house?

666
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,560
Can it be another day?

667
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,840
Tomorrow... I have the
scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.

668
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,940
Hmm, yeah.

669
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,080
Hey, you!

670
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,080
Your basket grazed by mirror!

671
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,550
If you said sorry--

672
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,610
250,000 for a passing score...

673
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,280
that's not expensive for you, right?

674
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,640
The tutoring fee for the STIC
is way more expensive.

675
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:21,480
We'll need approximately 30 clients.

676
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,950
If more than this,
it will be risky.

677
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,420
Anything less, it won't be worth it.

678
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,520
I've got almost 30 people
in my STIC group chat.

679
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,590
If you can get them to join,

680
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,730
you'll get 5,000 baht
discount per head

681
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,660
from your full payment.

682
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,430
But wait a minute.

683
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,300
You must make sure no one
else knows about this.

684
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,040
Especially, that loser Bank.

685
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,780
Don't mind that dumbass.

686
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,880
He won't say shit.

687
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,880
Why?

688
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,280
Didn't you hear?

689
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,320
That dumbass picked a fight in
the wrong neighborhood.

690
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,050
He's beaten up pretty badly.

691
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,200
The best part is...

692
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,530
he didn't make it to
the scholarship exam.

693
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,210
Seminar:
To Becoming Number One in Education - 2B COME WON

694
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,920
I believe that everyone here

695
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,850
wants to pass the STIC

696
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,420
for a brighter future you are hoping for.

697
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,190
Shit, it's Steve Pat.

698
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:44,300
I have a way for us all to
get satisfactory scores.

699
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,030
The only things you're
allowed in the exam room

700
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,840
is a 2B pencil,

701
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,900
eraser,

702
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,070
exam ID,

703
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,440
and passport.

704
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,410
Communication devices
are definitely not allowed.

705
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,320
So the phone that I will be using
to send the answers back to Thailand,

706
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,620
will be hidden inside the
toilet tank in the washroom.

707
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,490
I'll try and send the answers
in between the breaks.

708
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,090
The exam is split into 3 parts,

709
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,630
with 2 breaks.

710
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

711
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,460
How will the clients
use the answers in the exam?

712
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,370
Not everyone can
remember like you.

713
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:26,840
Barcode.

714
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:35,320
Everyone will receive a 2B pencil
with a barcode stuck on it.

715
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,980
The different widths
of the barcode

716
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,490
will represent the
answer choices.

717
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,090
Starting from the left to right.

718
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,090
The thickest is A,

719
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,730
then B, C, and D.

720
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,130
Sounds cool, huh?

721
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,660
But there's more.

722
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,400
The 4 pencils

723
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,600
will represent the answers
for the 4 section.

724
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,610
And the numbers next to the barcode
are for grid-in questions.

725
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,280
For the essay part,

726
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,580
they usually use
published articles.

727
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,580
I'll send you the
keywords and you can Google them.

728
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,120
Hey, it's mine.

729
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,420
It fell.

730
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,620
Hey, I'm saying for the essay.
You'll have to write them yourselves.

731
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,960
In short, on the exam day,

732
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,830
everyone will leave the meeting
point before 7:30 a.m.

733
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,370
to arrive at the exam
centers on time.

734
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,870
We will provide
motortaxis for you

735
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,570
to take you to the exam centers.

736
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,270
Finally...

737
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,480
everyone will have to pay
in cash within the next 2 weeks.

738
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,780
Otherwise, the deal is off.

739
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,790
I'd also like to emphasize that

740
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,690
what we are doing here
is highly confidential.

741
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,630
Any questions?

742
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,400
If there aren't...

743
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,670
I will end the seminar now.

744
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,200
We will become one,

745
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:07,740
to be number one in education in education.

746
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,140
We'll get the scores needed to
get in any universities.

747
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,210
We choose the university,

748
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,080
the universities don't get to choose us!

749
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,630
Whoa. That's rough, "Little Bank".

750
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,820
What's up?

751
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,990
I'm sorry.

752
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,320
That you missed out on
the scholarship.

753
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,530
Same.

754
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,030
On that day...

755
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,500
I really didn't mean to.

756
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,910
I don't know if you
meant it or not.

757
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,480
What I do know is that you

758
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,380
are also responsible
for what happened to me.

759
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,920
I have a proposition for you.

760
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,790
What is it?

761
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,320
Taking an exam.

762
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,700
Taking an exam or cheating an exam?

763
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,870
To me the word "cheat"

764
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,070
implies someone doesn't benefit.

765
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,370
But we will get money, and the
others will get good scores.

766
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
It's a win-win.

767
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,580
Bank.

768
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,480
To be honest,
we're both are losers here.

769
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,750
We're not born to win
like Pat or Grace.

770
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,330
We must try harder
to get what's ours.

771
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,060
Look, what happened to you?

772
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,300
It's not the same.

773
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,400
You cheated.

774
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:14,870
I was just unlucky.

775
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,470
True.

776
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,910
But don't you see? Even
if you don't cheat...

777
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,780
life cheats you anyways.

778
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,650
This is Grace's address.

779
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:35,460
I'll see you tomorrow if
you're interested.

780
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,870
Honest Commerce Printing

781
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,870
Honest Commerce Printing

782
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,870
Sit here, please.

783
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,280
Aren't you gonna take a seat?

784
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,460
Here is what's gonna happen

785
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,120
First...

786
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:49,160
we'll fly to Sydney and
take the STIC together.

787
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:00,610
Hey, Lynn.

788
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,910
You're missing a document.

789
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,710
Dad.

790
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,880
You remember that
show, Teen Genius?

791
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,620
They want me to
compete in Sydney.

792
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,800
They need your bank statement
for visa purposes.

793
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,060
Who are you going with?

794
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,530
With Bank.

795
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,830
Huh?

796
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:31,070
It's not just the two of
us, there's a teacher too.

797
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,640
Second...

798
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,940
You and I

799
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,250
will have to memorize
the answers, half each.

800
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,450
Don't forget...

801
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:41,550
Bank memorizes the first half,

802
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,950
and Lynn memorizes the second half.

803
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,420
Section 1 has 52 questions.

804
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,650
Start!

805
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,290
SECTION 1
52 Questions

806
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,290
SECTION 2
44 Questions

807
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,330
SECTION 3
16 Grid-in Questions

808
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:56,630
As for the last section,

809
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:01,200
you need to leave the exam early to
send the essay question in time.

810
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,000
Time's up for section 4.
Start the essay.

811
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,980
Memorizing the question and key words
shouldn't be a problem for you.

812
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:13,080
But the hard part is they
won't let you leave early.

813
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,620
To avoid any suspicion,

814
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,620
you have to act sick.

815
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,950
Sure.

816
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,160
I can throw up.

817
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,070
Do I have to puke now?

818
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,330
No!

819
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,740
How much am I getting?

820
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,950
1 million.

821
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,900
What about you guys?

822
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,400
2 million.

823
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,940
What do you say, Bank?

824
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:18,210
Everything is in your hands.

825
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,750
Okay.

826
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,190
We got it!

827
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,190
Right on time.

828
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,290
Yes!

829
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,560
You should've just said yes
from the beginning. Such a poser.

830
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,480
Hey, guys!

831
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,290
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

832
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,420
1:00 p.m., my ass.

833
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,090
The flight's at 11:00 p.m.

834
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,530
What's the rush?

835
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,400
There is one more thing
we need to rehearse.

836
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,370
Please stop.

837
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,910
You just can't keep on
grilling the weakling!

838
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,450
You must be enjoying...

839
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,790
seeing innocents
cry like this.

840
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:44,530
That's too much, Pat.
Way too much.

841
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,700
I've used up all my cards.

842
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,840
You guys are acting as if
we are really getting caught.

843
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,940
I told you I understand...

844
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,540
if you get caught,
we'll blame only you.

845
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,410
Last question before
heading to the airport.

846
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,610
Last question.

847
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,420
In character.

848
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,580
Ready?

849
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,320
What if Bank gets caught?

850
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,190
What will you say?

851
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,700
That's even more far-fetched.

852
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,430
I've never been friends with him.

853
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,630
I've seen him around
school for 4-5 years.

854
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,370
I've never seen
him with any friends.

855
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,670
He looks like ass.

856
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,940
And he's a weirdo.

857
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,880
Outside of school, he even got
beaten up and dumped in a landfill.

858
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,290
Are we done?

859
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,620
Stop!

860
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,590
Bank, stop!

861
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:47,890
Stop!

862
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:49,830
I said stop!

863
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,360
Fucker!

864
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,170
Bank!

865
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,810
What the hell is wrong with you?

866
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,350
You're the one who
told me to say this.

867
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,420
So, why are you mad at me?

868
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,460
Pat, stop.

869
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:18,590
Bank...

870
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,090
Bank, that's enough.

871
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:23,700
Why?

872
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,460
Why?

873
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,300
I...

874
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,030
You what?!

875
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,430
never...

876
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,670
told anyone that I
woke up in a landfill!

877
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,210
Now you know what I'm mad about!

878
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,110
All of you set me up, right?

879
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:44,920
You guys set me up so I
wouldn't get the scholarship, right?

880
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,990
You were all in it, right?

881
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,590
You guys knew, right?

882
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,790
You knew, right?

883
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,660
You knew, right?

884
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,460
Why the fuck aren't you answering?

885
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:01,630
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.

886
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,740
Calm down, Bank.

887
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:04,570
I don't want to fucking
hear what you have to say!

888
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,770
Bank, stop! Let's talk this out.
Let's talk this out. Let's talk this out.

889
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:14,880
Calm down. Calm down.

890
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,150
Okay?

891
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,750
I'm sorry, Bank.

892
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,790
I'm sorry.

893
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,290
I didn't think they'd
be so rough on you.

894
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,290
Bank, hear me out.

895
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,290
You're still taking
the STIC, right?

896
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,130
Fuck the STIC!

897
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,400
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.
Listen to me.

898
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,870
You listen to me!

899
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,870
I only have my mom.

900
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,610
She's like a hunchback,
doing laundry.

901
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:40,410
You--

902
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,870
I'm not rich like you.

903
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,740
That scholarship was my dream.

904
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:48,050
The dream for my mom
to live comfortably.

905
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,580
And then you came.

906
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,120
Bank...

907
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,850
If I don't pass the STIC,
my Dad will kill me.

908
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:55,190
Please, Bank.

909
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,320
Please.

910
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,790
I win, you win.
It's a win-win for the both of us.

911
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:06,730
Bank, I beg of you.

912
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:07,930
Then...

913
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:11,100
You should send those thugs to
beat up your Dad!

914
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,540
Why do you say shit like that?!

915
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,750
Didn't you tell me
that you needed him?

916
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,820
And if I didn't play dirty,

917
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,990
do you think he'd help you out?

918
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,660
Lynn!

919
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,530
Wait, let's talk about this.

920
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,560
Were you in on this?

921
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:15,130
I really didn't know.

922
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,040
Please try to understand Pat.

923
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,110
He did it because he wanted
to help with your plan.

924
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:26,110
Without considering
who would get hurt?

925
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:36,460
The Future of Laundry

926
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,390
Grace, refund the money.

927
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,490
I'm out.

928
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,500
Wait, Lynn.

929
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,900
Calm down.

930
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,670
Okay, I respect your decision.

931
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,700
If you're out, I'm out.

932
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,040
No more clients, okay?

933
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,670
It'll just be the 3 of us,
like we originally planned.

934
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,710
Don't you understand?

935
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,210
I said I'm out.

936
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,650
Okay.

937
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,090
I guess that's it.

938
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,530
I just have one request,

939
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,630
Don't be mad at me.

940
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,440
If I had half your brain,

941
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,970
I wouldn't do something
this stupid.

942
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,110
Please.

943
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,530
Flight leaves in 3 hours.

944
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,700
Let's get going, Lynn.

945
01:16:58,670 --> 01:16:59,670
Bank.

946
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,850
I'll go through with it.

947
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,460
At least there's money in it.

948
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,960
I won't get beaten up for free.

949
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:24,160
What if I told you that...

950
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:25,900
I don't wanna do it anymore.

951
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,000
I'm not asking you.

952
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,540
The only reason I'm here
is because of you.

953
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:37,140
The only reason I ended up in a
landfill is because of you.

954
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,110
The only reason all of this
shit is happening is because of you.

955
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,620
Don't you think you're also responsible?

956
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,950
SYDNEY

957
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,540
Here's your phone.

958
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,210
Lynn.

959
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,550
Hmm?

960
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,680
I'm sorry.

961
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,950
Sorry for what?

962
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,660
Well...

963
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,830
Your nose.

964
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,530
Hmm.

965
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:16,840
You know...

966
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,780
I've never been abroad before.

967
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,000
From tomorrow onwards,

968
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,070
we can go anywhere we want to.

969
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,750
Come on, let's take a selfie.

970
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,360
FINAL TEST

971
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,040
This year, the STIC test is cancelled
in the many countries across Asia.

972
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,910
Such as China and Korea.

973
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,610
This is because the
College Board has acknowledged

974
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:29,750
the STIC question were
leak prior to the test date.

975
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:34,420
This year the College Board has to
increase security procedures for the test.

976
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:36,150
To ensure no more problems.

977
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,080
All applicants.

978
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,620
Please gather here.

979
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,690
Come on guys! Wake up!

980
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:09,820
Good!

981
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:14,490
Congratulations.
You are the last group of people

982
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:17,630
who can go inside
and take the test.

983

Ask him! What the fuck
is wrong with him?!

Pat, Pat. Calm down.

01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,400
Step outside, I said.

01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,540

I'll give you a chance to
tell me everything!

01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:24,460
What did you do?

Speak to me!

1055
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,730
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
Go back to your test.

1056
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,450
You may start section 4 now!

Don't we need to leave
here before 7:30 a.m.?

1060
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,500
Yeah!

1061
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:32,470
It's 7 a.m., you're not paying enough!

1062
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:33,870
I've already paid you everything.

1063
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,710
Essay section starts now!

1064
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,360
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1065
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,660
Are you okay?

1066
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:03,690
Come on. Are you okay?

1067
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:05,700
I feel sick. Can we go home now?

1068
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,870
If you leave now, your exam
score will be cancelled.

1069
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:08,900
Do you understand?

1070
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,030
Wait!

1071
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,370
It's 7 a.m., why haven't
they sent the rest of the answers?!

1072
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,440
How do I know--

1073
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,990
Hello.

1074
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,870
Is Lynn here?

1075
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,400
I can't get in touch with her.

1076
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:48,910
I haven't seen her.

1077
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,810
She told me she went to
Sydney for a competition.

1078
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:55,410
Oh yeah.

1079
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:58,750
No wonder why we haven't seen her.

1080
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,550
I'm sure she'll
bring back a medal.

1081
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:04,320
But I found the
permission letter at home.

1082
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,320
I called, but no one answered.

1083
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,910
So, I came to the address on the sheet.

1084
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:48,000
Can someone tell me what
Lynn is doing in Sydney?

1085
01:40:59,140 --> 01:40:59,980
Huh?!

1086
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:07,650
Roger that. I can't see her.

1087
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,350
Okay, okay, I'm
looking. Checking.

1088
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:14,530
Yup. She's not here mate.

1089
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:17,660
Keep looking. I'm coming up.

1090
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:30,640
Did you find her?

1091
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,320
I'm out.

1092
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:58,840
If you don't answer me,
I'll go straight to the Headmistress.

1093
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,640
Tell me, what are guys you up to again?!

1094
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:37,640
Huh?!

1095
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:50,590
Lynn and Bank are dating!

1096
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,520
They went on a secret trip.

1097
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,940
Lynn was afraid you
wouldn't let her go.

1098
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,200
So, she lied.

1099
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:09,570
I really didn't know
how to stop her.

1100
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:15,910
I think it's best you talk to
your daughter, sir.

1101
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:22,020
Okay.

1102
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,870
C'mon!

1103
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:46,980
Sir,

1104
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,380
Love is a beautiful thing.

1105
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:14,910
What's the matter?

1106
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,840
It's 7 a.m. already.

1107
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:17,910
The motortaxis are leaving.

1108
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:19,640
They're saying we passed the agreed time.

1109
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:21,410
You explain to them what's going on

1110
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,250
Because I don't know a damn thing!

1111
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:24,980
I'll talk to them.

1112
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,550
What's with your leg?

1113
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,690
It's almost 7:30.

1114
01:44:29,790 --> 01:44:31,420
Where at the barcodes?

1115
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,520
I already paid the money.

1116
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,120
What's the wait? What's the wait?

1117
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:44,600
You'll get there in time!

1118
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:45,970
- I promise.
- Pat!

1119
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:12,830
Pat! We're out of stickers.

1120
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:22,640
Here you go. 500 each.

1121
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,410
We'll leave soon. We'll leave soon.

1122
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:46,530
Shit!

1123
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:51,400
(IN ENGLISH) Hey! Can you open the door?! Can
you open the door, please?!

1124
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,570
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1125
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,680
It's almost 7:30 a.m., Grace!

1126
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:39,680
Do we have all the answers?!

1127
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:41,450
No! 6 left.

1128
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,620
- Why it does say EDGE?
- Huh?

1129
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,290
It says EDGE!

1130
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:49,360
What's EDGE?!

1131
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,060
There's no reception.

1132
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,470
What happens if
we don't make it?

1133
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:05,140
And the money we paid?

1134
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,040
We won't make it!

1135
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,680
If we don't make it, we want our refund!

1136
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:13,980
C'mon.

1137
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,350
Did you get it, yet?

1138
01:47:57,630 --> 01:47:58,500

These 3 go to the
Bangkapi exam center.

1143
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:19,280
These 2 rows to Suttisarn.

1144
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,680
Did you get on, yet?

1145
01:48:21,050 --> 01:48:22,520
You didn't put your helmet on, put it on!

1146
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:24,960
One set each, pass it on.

1147
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,520
One set each!

1148
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,090
We're ready!

1149
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,460
Hurry up!

1150
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:31,400
Wear your helmet!

1151
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,230
Hey!

1152
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,580
Are you okay?

1153
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,420
(IN ENGLISH) No. I'm sick.

1154
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:58,420
This doesn't matter.

1155
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:00,990
You have to come back to
the test center with me.

1156
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,830
Now!

1157
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:02,730
Now!

1158
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,920
I'm from the embassy.

1159
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,450
A Thai student confessed to using
his phone as a dictionary.

1160
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:28,850
We're resolving the situation.

1161
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:30,790
(IN THAI) What will happen to him?

1162
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:33,460
They'll probably
cancel his scores.

1163
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,360
Worst case, he'll be banned
from the STIC forever.

1164
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,530
As for you, they'll be questioning you.
If there isn't anything else, you may leave.

1165
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,500
Just wait here.

1166
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:43,830
I'll go talk to them.

1167
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:29,310
Hold on.

1168
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,320
What's the matter?

1169
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,040
Huh?

1170
01:51:01,310 --> 01:51:02,880
May I use the toilet?

1171
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:03,880
Of course.

1172
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,540
Lynn!

1173
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:36,480
Welcome back. Welcome back.

1174
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:38,480
Mentor Lynn's FC here!

1175
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,350
Thanks so much, Lynn.

1176
01:51:45,590 --> 01:51:47,990
We're celebrating at my house tonight.

1177
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:49,230
Celebrate what?

1178
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:51,490
Did you know that Bank got caught?

1179
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,630
And my scores were cancelled, Pat.

1180
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,840
Well...

1181
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,340
we'll look for another
exam center for you.

1182
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,570
If you don't retake the exam,

1183
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,140
you won't be able to apply
to university in time.

1184
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:10,950
Hey, Lynn.

1185
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:12,850
You have to retake the exam.

1186
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:15,120
Pretty please?

1187
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:19,220
I've changed my mind.

1188
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:22,390
You've already got the
scores you needed.

1189
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,370
But,

1190
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:30,830
we can't go without you!

1191
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,470
You do know, right?

1192
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:41,650
That university exams aren't
multiple choices anymore.

1193
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,350
Even if I went with you,

1194
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:48,620
you wouldn't be able to copy me anyways.

1195
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,530
I'll get back on my own.

1196
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,490
Where's your boyfriend?

1197
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:33,730
Where is he?

1198
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,540
I wanted to invite him for dinner.

1199
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,610
Where is he, huh?

1200
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,550
Why didn't you tell me about him?

1201
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,590
- Dad!
- Huh?

1202
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,560
I have a confession to make.

1203
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,430
What is it, honey?

1204
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,670
What is it?

1205
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:29,150
Why do you choose
to study in Education?

1206
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:31,690
I want like to be a teacher,
like my father.

1207
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:34,460
So, I can use my knowledge
in the best way.

1208
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:42,170
Do you have experience in tutoring
or have you taught anyone before?

1209
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:45,370
Yes, I have.

1210
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:03,420
I scored 1,460 points on STIC

1211
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:07,120
Being a teacher isn't
just about being good academically.

1212
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:09,460
Do you think...

1213
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:12,730
you can be a good example
in other things as well?

1214
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:27,040
[Lynn. When are you coming?]
[Bank's taken his share, come get yours]

1215
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:28,680
[Come quick, we already miss you]

1216
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:30,410
I'm not going to lie.

1217
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:34,320
I've done a lot a bad
things in the past.

1218
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:35,820
But I will use them

1219
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,920
to teach myself and others.

1220
01:55:39,790 --> 01:55:42,290
[Lynn left the chat]

1221
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,550
It is such a waste,

1222
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:07,320
To be honest, with
your knowledge and abilities,

1223
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,520
You can apply for scholarships
to study abroad easily.

1224
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:14,320
Aren't you interested
in any of them?

1225
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,390
I think...

1226
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:20,930
there's someone else who
deserves it more than me.

1227
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:31,640
Student Expulsion Letter:
Thanaphon Viriyakul

1228
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:19,460
Bank:
[Meet me at my place tonight.]

1229
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:04,830
Come in.

1230
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:13,640
The store looks
fresh, Little Bank.

1231
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:15,810
Oh wait, it's Mister Bank now.

1232
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:17,610
You laundering money?

1233
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:21,420
You were expelled from
school because

1234
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,850
the embassy reported you, right?

1235
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,660
Hmm.

1236
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,490
What's next?

1237
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:34,360
That's the reason why
I asked you over.

1238
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:39,400
Did you apply for
the GAT/PAT exams?

1239
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:43,610
I have a proposition for you.

1240
01:58:48,110 --> 01:58:51,780
I have a fool-proof plan.
Much safer.

1241
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,550
We can get the answers
out to more people.

1242
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:58,620
More importantly, there're more
GAT/PAT clients than STIC clients.

1243
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,620
But this plan...

1244
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:06,160
can't be done without Mentor Lynn.

1245
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:31,020
How much more of this do you need?

1246
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:33,890
If your cut wasn't enough...

1247
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:37,290
my cut is still with Pat.

1248
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,460
You can go get it.

1249
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:44,830
No.

1250
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,900
Wait.

1251
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,240
It's not about how much money we got.

1252
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:52,980
It's about,

1253
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,610
from now on,

1254
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:57,380
how much more we can make.

1255
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:00,250
Lynn.

1256
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,790
From my calculations.

1257
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:06,390
This round...

1258
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,160
there's at least
10 million in it.

1259
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:13,630
Don't you think it's
worth the risk again?

1260
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,000
You were there.

1261
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:20,570
Even if we get caught,
it doesn't mean we go to jail.

1262
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,380
To be honest, Lynn.

1263
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,910
Why would you endure
studying for 4 years

1264
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:30,680
for a 5 figure salary?

1265
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:33,950
When you can earn millions right now.

1266
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:37,520
Why work a stupid desk job?

1267
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:49,870
That's probably because for me,

1268
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:52,340
no amount of money is worth it.

1269
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:02,680
Lynn.

1270
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:06,250
If you don't do this...

1271
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:09,920
I'll tell everyone that

1272
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:11,620
you're the mastermind
behind the STIC scandal.

1273
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:12,960
I guarantee you.

1274
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,560
You'll be banned from
studying abroad just like me.

1275
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:26,340
Fine. We're even then.

1276
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:31,070
It won't just be you!

1277
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:32,240
This includes Grace,

1278
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:33,280
Pat,

1279
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,880
and all the clients who
took the STIC too.

1280
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,950
Think about it...

1281
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,350
if the board finds out,

1282
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:41,550
they might even cancel all the
scores in Thailand.

1283
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:55,900
One last thing, Lynn.

1284
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:00,240
Your Dad will be so
disappointed in you.

1285
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,610
Don't be afraid, honey.

1286
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,440
We'll get through
this, no matter what.

1287
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:11,550
Smile.

1288
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,780
Smile with me.

1289
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:32,270
Ms. Rinrada?

1290
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:33,970
You once told me...

1291
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:37,410
if we win, we win together.

1292
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:40,240
If we lose, we lose together.

1293
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,150
I won't be the only one
taking all the blame.

1294
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:46,550
If you won't do it,

1295
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:49,150
I'll make sure you go down with me!

1296
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:57,990
What do you say, Lynn?

1297
02:03:01,530 --> 02:03:02,830
What's it going to be?

1298
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,340
Everything is up to you now.

1299
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,810
You're right.
Everything is up to me.

1300
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:46,640
We are here to record your confession

1301
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:49,880
to the suspected cheating on the STIC test.

1302
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:53,050
So, are you ready?

1303
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:00,020
(IN ENGLISH) I'm ready.
