1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,932
Previously on The Fosters...

2
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:04,786
She got into a fight
with her foster father?

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,186
That's how she landed in juvie.

4
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:07,594
This is for a few weeks, right?

5
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:08,744
You're stealing my pills?

6
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:10,206
What do you need all that money for anyway?

7
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,126
- I've been talking to Ana.
- Our birth mom?

8
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:13,725
You know, I'm just trying
to get back on my feet.

9
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:14,526
Here.

10
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,298
- Where are you going?
- It's my brother.

11
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:18,120
You're gonna get me sent back to juvie.

12
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:19,793
And Jude is gonna be stuck in that house.

13
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:21,037
Can I help you?

14
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:23,289
- I was looking for the metro.
- The Metro's a few miles from here.

15
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,822
Whoa, hey! What the
hell are you doing here?

16
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:28,248
- I just want to talk to Jude.
- No! Shut up! No!

17
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,250
Freeze! Get down on your knees now!

18
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:31,611
Hands on your head!

19
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,121
We are not sending these
kids back into the system.

20
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:37,109
- We really don't have the room.
- Then we'll make room.

21
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,425
Jesus, the trash needs to go out.

22
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,660
I shouldn't have to remind you.

23
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:43,475
- I took them out yesterday.
- Well, it's full again.

24
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:45,453
And get off your skateboard, please.

25
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,242
And, it's not because what you
did last night wasn't really dumb.

26
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:55,901
And I don't use those words
for lack of bigger ones.

27
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,098
It was really dumb.

28
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:59,225
My God, what were you thinking?

29
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:02,409
Running off, chasing
after some girl. Come one.

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,864
Even if it was to help her brother.

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,180
- Why didn't you just call me?
- I know, I know..

32
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,806
It was a big mistake.

33
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:11,175
It could have been a fatal mistake,

34
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,443
love, you had no idea
what you were walking into.

35
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,703
Could have been much much worse than that.

36
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,212
I mean, it won't happen again.

37
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:20,082
You're damn right it won't happen again.
I gotta be honest with you, my friend.

38
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,436
I was ready to drop the hammer.

39
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,190
But after talking with Lena, we have

40
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:29,029
decided that you are probably very aware

41
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,664
- of the potential consequences of your actions, yes?
- Yes.

42
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,098
And this is pretty out
of character for you,

43
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:38,500
so we are not going to ground
you, but I am telling you,

44
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:40,932
this will never ever happen again.

45
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,297
Hmm, where's Mariana?

46
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,666
Oh, she's still in the bathroom.

47
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,543
Mariana, come on! Let's go, babe.

48
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,732
We've gotta eat.

49
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,203
- Callie, can you put juice out for everybody?
- Yeah.

50
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:55,134
I didn't have time to do my hair.

51
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,573
Well, it's too late now sweetie.

52
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:57,762
We still have 15 minutes.

53
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,233
No no no. You guys have to walk
to school today. We have a thing.

54
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,383
Come on. Come eat.

55
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,839
I am not going to school
with my hair like this.

56
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:06,302
Well then you're not
going anywhere, ever again.

57
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,999
Stef, your pancakes are burning.

58
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,987
Great. I get to spend all
day looking like a ***.

59
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,761
***

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,108
- Enough.
- Ok, guys you have to be out the door in 10.

61
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,524
Stef and I have a meeting with Bill.

62
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:19,277
And then I'm gonna take Jude to come
later to school, to show him around.

63
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,476
He'll be ok. I promise.

64
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,892
I'm not gonna let them
split you two up again, ok?

65
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,504
Yeah.

66
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,522
All right, pancakes everybody.

67
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,844
Who wants pancakes? ***, you want pancakes?

68
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,599
Brandon, pass them around, please.

69
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,458
Ow! Ok, Jesus, how many times have we said,

70
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,294
no skateboard in the house?

71
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,062
- Have you taken your pill this morning?
- Yes.

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,363
- No.
- No.

73
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,086
- Jude, dude, come on.
- Sorry.

74
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,204
Some fruit, you guys.

75
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,018
Let's do this!

76
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:48,654
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
akumenang.com

77
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,631
What are you doing?

78
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,933
I didn't have time to
dry my hair this morning.

79
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,801
There were like 300 people in the bathroom.

80
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,636
You look fine, I'm sure
no one's going to notice.

81
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,988
What happened to your hair?

82
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,656
Jesus, you idiot!

83
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,975
He may be an idiot, but
damn your brother's so hot.

84
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,744
Oh my God, ew.

85
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,645
Hey, do you have any more you know what?

86
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,665
- I only have a couple left.
- No, and I can't get any more.

87
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,584
- Really?
- Really.

88
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,952
Ok, see you babes at lunch.

89
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,622
Bye. So, what happened last
night with your birth mom?

90
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,724
- Jesus found out.
- He found out?

91
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,959
- Did he freak?
- Completely.

92
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,928
- Did he go with you?
- No. He yelled at me.

93
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,631
So, how was it?

94
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,000
Honestly? It kind of sucked.

95
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,770
Well, at least you don't have to
invite her to your quinceanera.

96
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,805
That would've been awkward.

97
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,007
Come on, we're going to be late.

98
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,644
Have you thought any more
about what you want to do?

99
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,696
- About Callie and Jude?
- Mm.

100
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:41,881
No.

101
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,618
To be honest, I just keep thinking about

102
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,820
seeing you and Brandon in
that house with a gun...

103
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,622
- We were fine.
- I know you were fine.

104
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,025
I know that. But in my
mind, when you go to work,

105
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,829
you are writing parking tickets
and pulling cats out of trees.

106
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,664
- That's firemen.
- You know what I'm saying.

107
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,700
- Don't insult me.
- You know what I mean.

108
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,668
I just keep flashing back

109
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,970
to you storming into that house
with your gun pulled out...

110
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,006
It's what I do, love.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,009
I get this awful feeling in my stomach.

112
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,745
And I cannot help but
connect that back to Callie.

113
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,884
- Meaning?
- Meaning,

114
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,020
I know that you said we're not
going to put them back in the system

115
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:26,025
but, I have some really serious concerns.

116
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,695
- That's Bill.
- There's Bill.

117
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,697
Ok, bye.

118
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:39,471
- Hey.
- Hey, you...

119
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,741
Ah, did I just see Callie down the hall?

120
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,676
I don't know, did you?

121
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,511
I'm just surprised is all.

122
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,214
I mean, I figured after
last night they would've...

123
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,082
- Would've?
- Sent her back to juvie,

124
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,484
or another foster home or something.

125
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,171
Yeah, well, they're not.

126
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,989
I mean, not now, at least.

127
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,991
Mm. Good.

128
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,978
- You ok?
- Totally. I'm fine.

129
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,865
- You're sure?
- Brandon, I'm fine.

130
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,566
Are we still on for Friday?

131
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,735
It's not every weekend
my parents go out of town.

132
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,704
- You know I'm down.
- Good.

133
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,374
Now get to class.

134
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,215
Then a few years later, when
Callie was 10, I think...

135
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,483
yes, that's right.

136
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,385
Her mother died suddenly.

137
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,421
Her father obviously wasn't in the picture,

138
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,122
and there were no other
family members to call on.

139
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,124
So, they were put into the system.

140
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,226
Unfortunately, they haven't
been able to land anywhere,

141
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,928
for more than six months at a time.

142
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,797
Could I trouble you for
some more coffee, please?

143
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,131
Yeah, of course.

144
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,100
Now, we keep trying to put
them somewhere permanent,

145
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,431
but then something happens,

146
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,522
and we have to move
them onto somewhere new.

147
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,807
Something happens? What
exactly does that mean?

148
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,643
- Something like last night?
- I feel terrible about that.

149
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,511
That is my fault.

150
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,380
I had an emergency on another case.

151
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,671
Otherwise, I would've been there for Callie

152
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:56,672
and connected her with Jude,

153
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,518
and none of that would've
happened. Thank you.

154
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,389
Look, they're really great kids,

155
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,058
they've just had bad luck.

156
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,962
That's just so heartbreaking.

157
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,832
So you are looking for
something permanent for them?

158
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,834
Always.

159
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,904
We already have three teenagers.

160
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,874
What do you think?

161
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:36,655
So, the seventh grade classes
are mostly on the south corridor.

162
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,340
With all the high school kids?

163
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,459
- Yeah.
- Does that mean I get to see Callie?

164
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,112
Well, not all the time,
but she'll be around.

165
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,498
And if you need anything
at all, I'm always here, ok?

166
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,134
- Hey.
- Morning.

167
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,004
- Everything all right?
- Um.

168
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,873
Hey Jude, why don't you
wait out in the hall,

169
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,842
and I'll take you to class in a sec.

170
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,143
Hey.

171
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,747
What's up?

172
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,683
So, I was on my way to class

173
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,521
and I found this lying by a trash can.

174
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,424
Pills.

175
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,265
Well, you know what this means.

176
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,433
Locker search. Everyone line up.

177
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,180
- What's this?
- It's ibuprofen. Over the counter.

178
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:33,653
For cramps.

179
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:35,855
Uh, you're good.

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,561
How many kids are you selling to anyway?

181
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,962
I don't know, five or six?

182
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,698
You better hope none of them are
keeping their stash in their lockers.

183
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:52,272
- Got the report filed.
- Good boy.

184
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,606
- You driving?
- I'm driving.

185
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,691
Ok.

186
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,486
- So, that was quite a night?
- Yes, it was.

187
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,022
Anybody run away this morning?

188
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:11,908
That's funny. No. Nope.

189
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,060
Gave Brandon quite a talking to though.

190
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,063
But I've decided not to
ground him, so he's thrilled.

191
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:19,198
What? You're kidding, right?

192
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,000
No.

193
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,969
The kid basically went awol last night,

194
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,137
damn near got himself killed.

195
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:26,706
Yeah, exactly. So, Lena thought that

196
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,875
he's very well aware
of the consequences and

197
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,827
no benefit to punishing him.

198
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:34,581
- Oh, Lena thought.
- Ok, take it easy. Easy.

199
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,617
First time he's ever done
anything like this before.

200
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,619
Right, which is all the more
reason to set boundaries.

201
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,721
We set plenty of boundaries for him.

202
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,540
Well, apparently not enough.

203
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:44,691
God.

204
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,527
Look, I'm sure hippie-dippie Lena with her

205
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,163
PhD in child... whatever the hell it is,

206
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:52,432
has some opinions about why punishing him

207
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:55,101
would damage his blossoming sense of self,

208
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,936
but the thing is, Stef, I'm his dad.

209
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,238
Yes, Mike. I'm well aware of that.

210
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:00,840
Right, and you should've
talked to me about it first.

211
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,811
Come on, it'll be fun.

212
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,979
I told you nobody'd go.

213
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:08,581
I thought we had a good time.

214
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,799
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

215
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,551
Tell me that you'll go out with me again.

216
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,986
Yeah, I don't think so.

217
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,787
Why do you have to be
such a bitch? Come on.

218
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:16,622
Hey, she said no, man.

219
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,791
- Yeah, I heard her.
- So, why are you still in her face? Take a walk.

220
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,593
Why don't you just relax, ok?

221
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,695
Why don't you get out of here?

222
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,365
- Watch yourself, crackhead.
- What'd you call me?

223
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,484
- Jesus, knock it off...
- Hey! What is going on here?

224
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,139
Huh?

225
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:47,687
Need the bathroom, Jude? Go ahead.

226
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,626
Are you ok?

227
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,662
- Mm-hm.
- Finding everything?

228
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,464
Yeah.

229
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:01,534
Ok, good. I just wanted to make sure.

230
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,236
Did you see Bill?

231
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,470
Yep.

232
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,140
Did he say anything?

233
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:08,374
Like what?

234
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,509
I don't know. Like anything?

235
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,045
He said, "hi."

236
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,881
- Why?
- Just wondering.

237
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,083
Now get back in there. Learn something.

238
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,994
This is not like you to get into a fight.

239
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:30,730
I know, I'm sorry. The
guy was being rude to Lexi.

240
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,732
Ok. So, you can't have a
conversation about that?

241
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:35,635
- Why did this have to get physical?
- I don't know.

242
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,704
Did you take your pill today?

243
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,706
Yeah.

244
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,310
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. A hundred percent.

245
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:50,016
Ok, maybe it's time we called Dr.
Hitchin's and set another appointment.

246
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,885
I don't need to see... can't
I have a bad day once in awhile

247
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,854
without being some psych case?

248
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:03,830
All right. Don't let this happen again.

249
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:06,633
If you feel yourself getting worked up,

250
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,601
just take a deep breath and walk away.

251
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,605
Ok? Go to class.

252
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:33,326
Hey, you got in a fight? Lexi told me.

253
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:36,779
I didn't take my meds,
so I was kind of jumpy.

254
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:37,897
Why aren't you taking your pills?

255
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,865
I'm skipping a few days to save your ass

256
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:42,068
so mom wouldn't notice
the pills are missing.

257
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,671
Don't worry, they didn't
find anything in the lockers,

258
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,907
- so you're fine.
- Hey, calm down.

259
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,610
- You're gonna get us both busted.
- Us or you?

260
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:53,429
You're welcome, by the way.

261
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,455
- Hey.
- Hey.

262
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:07,060
I was just avoiding the whole
"who do I sit with at lunch" thing.

263
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,028
Gotcha.

264
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,230
- I'll let you practice.
- No, no. You can stay.

265
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,266
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

266
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:20,239
So, you're really not
getting grounded or anything?

267
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:23,176
Are your moms usually that cool

268
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,612
or is it just 'cause you
never do anything wrong?

269
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:27,947
No, I mean, I do stuff.

270
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,916
It's not like I've never
got in trouble before.

271
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,684
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,920
- Like?
- Like, I...

273
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:35,855
- I got caught stealing.
- Yeah?

274
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:37,440
- Yes.
- What?

275
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,643
A car. Yeah.

276
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,429
A matchbox when I was five.

277
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:46,232
Yeah. No, you're bad news.

278
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,334
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Hm.

279
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,136
What?

280
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,272
Nothing. No, I just...

281
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:56,776
I wonder how...

282
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,745
you even know who you are if you just do

283
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,947
what everybody else thinks you should do?

284
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,933
Nice, do you play?

285
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:06,786
Uh, a little. I used to.

286
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,556
My mom taught me some before she...

287
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,559
Before she?

288
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,304
Lena, honey?

289
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,240
- Hi.
- Hey.

290
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,408
Listen, I'm sorry. Mike is right behind me.

291
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,410
- Why is Mike coming over?
- Because he thinks we should

292
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:41,181
have a discussion, a conversation
perhaps, in regards to Brandon.

293
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,352
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:48,255
Mike and I, we were talking at work and...

295
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:52,058
he feels that perhaps,

296
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,895
we've gone a little too easy on Brandon,

297
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,699
and that he may indeed need
some sort of punishment.

298
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:00,801
Ok, I hear that.

299
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,702
But unfortunately, we
already spoke to Brandon.

300
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,504
We can speak to him again.

301
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,606
Mike, I think that
Brandon really understands

302
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:09,209
the consequences of his
actions and there's no value...

303
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,245
With all due respect, what you
think isn't really my concern...

304
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,016
Hey, wait a minute, Mike.
Lena is his parent, too.

305
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,118
Respectfully, that may be true.

306
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:19,986
But I am his father and you're his mother.

307
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,022
Excuse me?

308
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,825
- You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

309
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,093
What do you think?

310
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:29,930
Lena, you know that I think
you are his mother, too.

311
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:30,964
No, that's fine. That's fine.

312
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:32,732
I'm not his mother, I'm not his father.

313
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,934
- Mike is right.
- No, he is not.

314
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,803
What do you think about
Brandon's punishment?

315
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:39,472
I think that Mike has a point.

316
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,578
- Hey bud.
- What's up?

317
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,314
What are we talking about?

318
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,148
We're having a discussion right now.

319
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,184
The three of us, if you don't mind.

320
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,286
Actually, we're talking
about your punishment.

321
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,355
But I thought I wasn't punished.

322
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,959
You are. You're grounded, one
week. School and home, that's it.

323
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,127
- What? No, but I made plans.
- Oh, you made plans.

324
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,896
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's funny,

325
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,731
'cause you didn't have
any trouble blowing off

326
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,700
your plans to be at the
music competition, did you?

327
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,568
Ok, and since when do you even care?

328
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:09,669
- Excuse me?
- Brandon?

329
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,538
Where have you been?
No, no, seriously, dad.

330
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,607
When do you even care? You're never around.

331
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,343
When have you ever cared? You call me once,

332
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:20,180
like every two days,
five minute phone calls.

333
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,148
Why should I even listen to you?

334
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:25,452
Great. This is awesome.

335
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:30,957
Let me know who I'm supposed
to be taking orders from.

336
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:42,736
That went well.

337
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,543
Honey, listen, that's...

338
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,582
not supposed to be the way...

339
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,675
- I'm listening to that.
- You can't skip your pills.

340
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:22,842
Well, what do you want me to do?

341
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:25,612
Thanks to someone I seem
to be missing a whole bunch.

342
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,781
- You got a better idea?
- You still have a few left, right?

343
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,482
How many? Like a week or so?

344
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:32,202
- Like, three.
- Ok, how about this...

345
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,088
you keep taking them and you
take them till you run out,

346
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,556
and we can tell moms you
dropped the rest down the sink.

347
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,075
Yeah, ok. Fine.

348
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,061
In case I haven't said it...

349
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,013
You haven't.

350
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,932
Well, I'm sorry. For all of this.

351
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,934
It's cool.

352
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,688
Sixteen.

353
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,328
And this one?

354
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,364
No, you know that. What do you have to do?

355
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,468
You have to divide it by the "y."

356
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,374
It's four. The answer's four.
You should've known that.

357
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,109
You should've known that.

358
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:30,243
I did know that.

359
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:32,779
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

360
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,881
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah!

361
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:37,083
So cheeky!

362
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,619
- Stop it!
- No, you stop it.

363
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,621
How long are we going to be here?

364
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:47,527
I don't know, kid.

365
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:53,516
- Finish your homework.
- Ok.

366
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,146
I am sorry I ambushed you, Lena. All right?

367
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,949
This was something that Mike felt
very strongly about, obviously.

368
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:18,725
When you feel like talking
to me, Lena. Let me know.

369
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,761
I thought we were on the same
page. I thought we agreed.

370
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:23,830
I've never felt like such a
stepmother in my entire life.

371
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:25,765
- Lena...
- And just so we're clear,

372
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,568
I am done disciplining Brandon if
this is the way it's going to be.

373
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,371
I'm just going to be
good-time stepmom from now on.

374
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:33,406
You want some candy,
Brandon? Sure, help yourself!

375
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,542
Want some cigarettes? Smoke
it up! Lung cancer be damned!

376
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:37,544
Want some booze? No? How about some heroin?

377
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,346
Oh, wow. Point taken.
Please put down the knife.

378
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:43,466
You're scaring me. Lena, come on,
love. What was I supposed to do?

379
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:47,120
Mike is Brandon's father.
This was a big decision

380
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:49,322
and we didn't include him in it.

381
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:51,991
Can you imagine how you would
feel if something like this

382
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,860
- happened with Mariana or Jesus?
- It's not the same thing.

383
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,162
- Mike is not the twins father.
- Obviously.

384
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:59,132
You know that's not what I
meant. You would not like it...

385
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,035
- If parental decisions were being made without me...
- Without you.

386
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,836
Yes, I get that, but in
what world is it ok for you

387
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,738
to take Mike's side in front of me?

388
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:09,442
I didn't take his side,
Lena. I simply said...

389
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,878
You humiliated me in front of him.

390
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:15,615
I'm sorry, that is not what I meant to do.

391
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,318
But you asked, what was I supposed to say?

392
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:21,621
You lie, Stef. You lie.

393
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:28,194
Ok, I'm sorry.

394
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:32,132
It's not easy for me either, you know.

395
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,201
It's no fun playing
peacekeeper between you and Mike

396
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:39,139
when you're acting like Israel
and Palestine. It kind of stinks.

397
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,612
Look, Brandon has three parents, period.

398
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,481
No getting around it. Mike
had no right to say otherwise.

399
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,719
I know that's not what
he thinks, I really do.

400
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:57,323
And we're all just trying to do our best to

401
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,625
figure this out.

402
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,297
I'm going to go talk to Brandon.

403
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:07,133
All right?

404
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:19,779
- We're ok for now?
- We're good.

405
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:20,980
Great.

406
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:26,786
- B?
- Yeah?

407
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,424
I get that you're frustrated,

408
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,661
it seems to be a common theme
around the house these days.

409
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:38,665
But, that's no reason to
talk to your father that way.

410
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,267
He's a good man, he's a good dad,

411
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:43,603
and he does care very,
very much, he always has.

412
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:46,139
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

413
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,340
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

414
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:51,044
I didn't mean any of it.

415
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,279
- It's just...
- I know.

416
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,148
You know what you need to do.

417
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:59,185
By the way, Lena wants you to know,

418
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,955
that if you ever need any
heroin, she's happy to help.

419
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,623
Huh?

420
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:06,659
Never mind, that was funnier
in my head. I'm sorry.

421
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,529
Oh, you playing again?

422
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,366
I remember the day you bought that.

423
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,603
Saved up all your money, all on
your own, I was so proud of you.

424
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:24,110
Call your dad.

425
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,378
Yeah.

426
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,924
Hi. Dinner is not quite ready yet.

427
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,960
Do you want something to drink or... ?

428
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:42,695
Is everything ok?

429
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,964
Yeah, I was just wondering
if you had any chores for me.

430
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,599
Chores?

431
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,535
Yeah, well, foster families are
gonna send us away right away,

432
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,537
they usually give us chores and stuff.

433
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:54,707
You know what?

434
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,310
You could really help me...

435
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,214
I forgot the salad forks.

436
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:10,189
So, are you and Stef married?

437
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:14,894
Well, not exactly. Not legally, no.

438
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:17,196
We're married in our hearts, I guess.

439
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,999
That's basically the same thing, right?

440
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:22,135
Basically, yeah.

441
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:25,038
Yeah.

442
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,540
Everyone, grab a seat.

443
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:30,610
So, we have something
to talk about, obviously.

444
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,512
Uh, Stef and I had our meeting with bill,

445
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:34,480
and we've come to a decision.

446
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:38,551
We are not in a position to offer
Jude and Callie a home forever.

447
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,720
But we would like you guys
to be as comfortable and safe

448
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:43,423
as possible, until bill does
find you a permanent home.

449
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:46,426
- However long that may take.
- It could be a week, it could be a year.

450
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,560
- We just don't know.
- Yeah.

451
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,429
We want this to be your
very last way station

452
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:52,165
ever, ever, ever. Ok?

453
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,336
So, that means, we need to get
you guys out of the living room.

454
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,905
I think you'll be ok to camp
down there one more night,

455
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,140
but tomorrow we're having
some beds delivered,

456
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,009
so after school let's help
get them settled in, ok?

457
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,979
Yes, Brandon and Jesus, could
use a little muscle, all right?

458
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:08,915
Jude, my sweet, new, young friend.

459
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,950
You'll be moving in with Jesus.

460
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:16,556
And Callie, you'll be moving
into Mariana's room, all right?

461
00:25:18,946 --> 00:25:20,517
Hey Mariana! Lexi is here!

462
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:28,235
Hey.

463
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,636
Oh, hey.

464
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,439
I just wanted to say thanks.

465
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:34,274
I know you were just
trying to stick up for me.

466
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,276
I... I didn't mean to yell at you.

467
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:40,113
You didn't have to go
all Iron Man on his ass,

468
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:44,051
but, you know, thank you.

469
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,767
What are you doing? Come
on, I need your help.

470
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:02,536
I have to get rid of a bunch of stuff

471
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,721
so Callie can move into my
room. It's a freaking nightmare.

472
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:06,807
Seriously, I don't understand why

473
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,542
they just can't move into the dining room?

474
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,444
It's not like we ever use it, right?

475
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:11,712
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,280
Maybe we can put them in the closet

477
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,582
or under the stairs, like in Harry Potter?

478
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,484
I mean, come on guys. Let's
think about how they must feel.

479
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,520
They're not here forever. Let's try to
make them feel a little more welcome.

480
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:22,089
Easy for you to say. You're
not giving up anything.

481
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:32,833
Lexi, come here.

482
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:56,723
Wait, what do you mean? I thought
you weren't getting grounded?

483
00:26:56,758 --> 00:27:00,393
What about Callie? If you're getting
punished, is she going back to juvie?

484
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,380
No. No, she's actually going to
be living with us for a while now.

485
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,252
Wait... you're not jealous, are you?

486
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,337
Of Callie? No.

487
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:13,223
Ok. 'Cause you have no reason to be.

488
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,076
Yeah, obviously. You know,
that's cool of your moms.

489
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,327
Letting her stay.

490
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:19,913
She was just trying to help
save her brother, right?

491
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,949
Yeah.

492
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:28,922
Brandon called you, right?

493
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,858
- Yeah, said he was sorry.
- Good.

494
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:34,878
He was kind of right, though.

495
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:37,764
No, he was not. He was
not right to talk to you...

496
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,751
Not about the me not caring part.

497
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,670
I mean, look, when was the
last time that you and Lena

498
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,673
really talked to me about Brandon?

499
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,576
Ok, listen, Mike. You're right. We have...

500
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:51,428
No, no, no. I'm not blaming you.

501
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:54,314
I'm not saying it's your
fault. That's not what I mean.

502
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:57,617
You guys are so good and
involved and there all the time.

503
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,404
I just feel like it was so
easy to turn the reins over.

504
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,355
I don't want to do that any more, Stef.

505
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:04,191
I don't want to hand my kid over.

506
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,460
I don't want to be some
half-assed version of a dad.

507
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,295
You're not a half-assed version of a dad.

508
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,363
I know, but you know what I mean.

509
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,796
You guys know she just
got out of juvie, right?

510
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:28,682
Kelsey, I told you not to tell anyone.

511
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,517
I know, but I think that they should know.

512
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,486
Watch out, she'll totally
shiv you or something.

513
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,454
- Shank.
- Huh?

514
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:36,707
A shiv is a thing, a
shank's what you do with it.

515
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,459
- Oh.
- My mom's a cop.

516
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:43,563
Damn girl, it's like Grand
Theft Auto around your place.

517
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,432
Seriously.

518
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,339
Hey Callie! Over here.

519
00:28:58,346 --> 00:29:00,063
So, how are you?

520
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:03,216
I mean, I know it's been a
crazy couple of days for you.

521
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:05,168
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

522
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:06,970
So, where are you from?

523
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:09,723
Just around.

524
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:12,826
Uh-huh. Great.

525
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,861
Is that your brother you
were talking to this morning?

526
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,747
Yeah, that's Jude.

527
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:18,849
Wow, he's totally adorable.

528
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,767
Ah, he's all right.

529
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,903
- I like your bracelets.
- Thank you.

530
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:26,840
I should get some like that. So cool.

531
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,477
Yeah, I really like your scarf.

532
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:34,347
So, how long are you
guys gonna be here for?

533
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:38,618
A couple weeks, a month... six months?

534
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:42,389
I have no idea.

535
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:45,358
It's not really up to me.

536
00:29:45,393 --> 00:29:48,228
Right... 'cause we should
get you in some clubs.

537
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:50,197
You know, so you can meet more people.

538
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:53,934
It's got to be hella boring hanging
out with Brandon all the time.

539
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:56,069
You'd know a lot about that.

540
00:29:56,104 --> 00:30:00,040
Right? We're together
pretty much all the time.

541
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:02,075
Stef and Lena are so
supportive of our relationship.

542
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,628
Stef even buys his condoms.

543
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,781
Hello! How great is that?

544
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:12,469
Oh, it's really great.

545
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,193
So...

546
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:21,328
I just...

547
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:23,530
Yes.

548
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,233
So, I wasn't really right
in the head yesterday.

549
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:28,235
Meaning...

550
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:32,038
Meaning, um, I probably shouldn't have...

551
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:34,975
It's cool. But you probably shouldn't

552
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,877
go kissing me every
time you have a bad day.

553
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:39,880
Oh yeah? Who said you're the
only girl I kissed yesterday?

554
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:42,048
Oh, really?

555
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,984
Really.

556
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:37,504
You got a little...

557
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:42,309
What is it and who gave it to you?

558
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:44,377
You can tell me or we can call
the police and you can tell them.

559
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,379
It's up to you.

560
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,548
What's it gonna be, Kelsey?
Where'd you get the drugs?

561
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:01,256
Where is she?

562
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,162
This one kid, Connor,
was pretty nice, though.

563
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,230
They're reading this book,

564
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:10,232
a Wrinkle in... something.

565
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,100
- Time?
- Huh?

566
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:14,269
- A Wrinkle in Time.
- Oh yeah, that's it.

567
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:17,772
Anyways, I don't get it.
It's kind of confusing.

568
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:22,010
What?

569
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:24,679
Why are both my moms home?

570
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:36,758
What's going on?

571
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,727
Mariana, could you take
Jude upstairs, please?

572
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,428
We need to talk to Callie.

573
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,266
Yeah, sweets, it's ok. She'll be right up.

574
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:46,434
Callie?

575
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:59,981
We've been told that
you... stole Jesus's pills?

576
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:03,852
And have been selling them
at school? Is this true?

577
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:08,790
Is this true?

578
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:15,597
- No.
- You sure about that?

579
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:17,465
Uh-huh.

580
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,434
Then why would this
student say that you did?

581
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:25,206
I guess I'm just an easy target.

582
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:28,209
Right.

583
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:31,346
Will you give us a minute, please?

584
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:49,831
So, what do we do?

585
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,866
I don't know, maybe we should call Mike.

586
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,636
- Oh, yes, feisty.
- Uh-huh.

587
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,671
- I'm trying, love.
- I know.

588
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,740
- Mike didn't mean what he said about...
- I know, I know.

589
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,342
Mike called me, we talked.

590
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,277
Really, what'd he say?

591
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,245
That's between me and Mike.

592
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:08,366
So, did you ask Talya to
have lunch with Callie?

593
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,118
Wait, what? They had lunch?

594
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:13,054
- Talya has lost her mind.
- She's insecure, bro.

595
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:15,223
I mean, suddenly got this
hot 16 year old girl...

596
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:18,960
- You think Callie's hot?
- You don't?

597
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,128
I better figure something out,

598
00:34:20,162 --> 00:34:22,263
or Talya's going to have
a complete meltdown on me.

599
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:25,150
Better do something big.
Make her feel special.

600
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:27,168
But I'm grounded, remember?

601
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,170
Improvise.

602
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:39,881
Hey, you didn't make
any plans tonight, right?

603
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:42,534
No, good, don't. I...

604
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:45,553
I'm gonna sneak out, and come see you.

605
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:48,556
No, I don't care if I get
in trouble. It's worth it.

606
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:51,760
Ok. Bye.

607
00:34:57,366 --> 00:34:58,616
Where's Jude?

608
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,569
He's reading magazines in my room. He's ok.

609
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:03,538
Good.

610
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:05,373
I don't know what I'm gonna tell him.

611
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:07,075
So, what happened?

612
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:09,310
They think that I stole
your brother's pills.

613
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:13,982
- What did you tell them?
- Well, I didn't tell them that it was you,

614
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,817
if that's what you're asking me.

615
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,055
Why not?

616
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:22,657
As if they'd believe me.

617
00:35:57,819 --> 00:35:59,219
Hey.

618
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:06,126
Are you really going to let
Callie take the fall for you?

619
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,994
They're gonna send her away.

620
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:13,433
They're gonna be so mad at me.

621
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,406
The other night,

622
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,510
when Ana just took all
that money from me...

623
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,147
like I was an ATM or something,

624
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:30,417
not even a person, much less her daughter.

625
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:36,223
I thought, "well, hey...

626
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:41,895
at least, I have two
moms at home who love me."

627
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:47,734
- They're gonna hate me.
- They're not gonna hate you.

628
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:51,771
- I promise.
- They're totally going to cancel my quinceanera.

629
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,648
Will you come with me to tell them?

630
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:23,136
Surprised you want to consort
with a known drug trafficker.

631
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,239
Well, did you do it?

632
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:28,141
What do you think?

633
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,279
I think you're playing the G chord wrong.

634
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:36,983
Try the six string on the third fret.

635
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:41,888
There you go.

636
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:44,758
Thank you... for the guitar.

637
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,026
You're welcome.

638
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:55,635
I can't remember anything.

639
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,470
I think that was a C there.

640
00:37:57,505 --> 00:37:59,606
- I was right?
- Here.

641
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,643
And then, I think if
you move these two down,

642
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:06,379
you'll make another chord there.

643
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:12,085
Nice.

644
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:24,164
Hi.

645
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:31,638
It was me, I did it.

646
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:32,973
Did what?

647
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:35,942
The pills.

648
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:40,647
Ok.

649
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,752
You care to explain.

650
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:48,588
I was feeling like a freak.

651
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,424
Just tired being the kid with add.

652
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,160
Everyone always asking me,
"did you take your pill?"

653
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,563
"Did you take your pill?"
You know, so I stopped.

654
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:59,432
I started hiding them in my pocket.

655
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,368
Kelsey saw them at school

656
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:04,004
and she told me she heard
they make you really smart,

657
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:06,039
and really focused.

658
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:08,108
She needed some for a
paper she had to write.

659
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:11,277
So, I gave her one.

660
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:13,213
And some more.

661
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:16,950
And things just got out of hand.

662
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:28,495
G, C...

663
00:39:29,897 --> 00:39:31,631
Hey Brandon,

664
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:33,500
will you excuse us for a sec?

665
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:35,485
Uh, yeah.

666
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:41,391
Um, well...

667
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:43,693
it would appear that we were given

668
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,346
some false information.

669
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,367
And I promise I'm going to find
out how that happened exactly.

670
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,520
Yeah, we're very sorry
that we didn't believe you.

671
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:59,325
We feel that trust is
something that has to be earned.

672
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,861
Right?

673
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:06,032
We would really like
to start earning yours.

674
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,902
- Yeah.
- Ok.

675
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,672
All right. Let's go.

676
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,546
I'm glad we're staying. I like it here.

677
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,880
Yeah?

678
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,733
Don't like it too much.

679
00:40:50,511 --> 00:40:52,545
God, I can't remember anything.

680
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,415
Just keep trying.

681
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:57,233
I mean, it'll come back.

682
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:42,730
