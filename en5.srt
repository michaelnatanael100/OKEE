1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:02,043
Previously on The Fosters...

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,917
My foster father caught my little brother

3
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:05,552
wearing one of his ex-wife's dresses.

4
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:07,454
Started beating the crap out of him.

5
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:09,389
Foster siblings are not allowed to...

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,991
- Hook up?
- There's nothing going on between Callie and I.

7
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,059
You look nice.

8
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,561
What do you want from me?

9
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,030
Stimulating conversation... and sex.

10
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:18,998
You could have any girl you wanted.

11
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:20,467
Why'd it have to be my best friend?

12
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,369
- You read her journal?
- Yes. Just listen to me...

13
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,571
I can't do this anymore! I'm done.

14
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,906
- She told you.
- She didn't tell me what it said.

15
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:29,609
I already know everything
I need to know about you.

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,077
Callie, wait.

17
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,318
- Oh, my God.
- What?

18
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,920
I meant to pick up some guacamole
from that place you love.

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,256
Oh, that stuff's so good, too.

20
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:47,227
Sorry, Mariana called, then Jude
needed me, and I just... forgot.

21
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,195
Remember when you used to love me?

22
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,930
Don't do that. I feel terrible.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,933
I guess, just salsa will be fine...

24
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,872
Hey, where do you think
you're going, young man?

25
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,040
Can't we just go up and play video games?

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,933
No, no. You know the rules.

27
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,416
No girls allowed in your bedroom
unless one of us is upstairs.

28
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,251
So, we're just supposed to stay here,

29
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:08,887
hang out with your lame
old friends all night?

30
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:10,822
Sandra just spent 20 minutes telling us

31
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,291
how she installed her own
toilet. That's not fair.

32
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:16,326
No, what's not fair is when
I make you start cleaning up

33
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,861
all the dirty plates around the house,

34
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,230
because you just called
our friends lame and old.

35
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,032
Knock yourself out.

36
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,594
- Taking out the trash?
- Hey, enough. Go, go, go.

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,071
Lexi, you can help, please.

38
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,806
Why does she have to be here?

39
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:33,309
She is your brother's girlfriend.

40
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:36,813
Look, I know that this has got
to be hard for you right now,

41
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,283
- but she's your best friend.
- Not anymore.

42
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:43,386
Just like families,
sometimes friends fight.

43
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,954
And lie to your face?

44
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,291
And they still love you no matter what.

45
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:52,162
Yeah, well... if that's
love, I don't want it.

46
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,970
- Mariana!
- Oh, my God, Garret!

47
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,440
- Mariana, you look beautiful.
- Where are your mothers?

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,874
Kitchen.

49
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,914
Wow, you look... different.

50
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,784
Puberty. Turns out the rumor's
true. It really does change things.

51
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:18,221
That's what happens when we
don't see each other for a year.

52
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:21,823
What's happening with you? Tell
me everything. Max detail. Go.

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,597
Thank you for bringing the casserole.

54
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:30,699
- Vegetarian?
- Vegan.

55
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,601
We can barely get food on
the table three times a day.

56
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,936
I don't know how you guys
find time to be so healthy.

57
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:38,940
I don't do it. All credit
to the chef in the family.

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,644
- Where's Stef?
- She's out back, womaning the grill.

59
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,587
That's the nicest thing she's said
to me in I don't know how long.

60
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:50,156
We're going through a rough patch.

61
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:54,627
- We all go through those.
- Yeah, did they usually last two years?

62
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,529
Is everything ok?

63
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,667
We're talking about splitting up.

64
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,902
What?

65
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:07,674
No, that's impossible. You can't
do that, you're Kelly and Jenna.

66
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,209
I know.

67
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,212
After 20 years, you start
thinking it's really forever,

68
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,581
that nothing can pull you apart.

69
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:18,151
- So, what changed?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:23,323
We did, I guess. You know how it is,

71
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:26,259
you're so focused on kids,
work, and paying the bills,

72
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,528
that you stop paying
attention to each other.

73
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:32,398
All the things you used to do for
each other, the little stuff...

74
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:35,268
one day, you start
forgetting to do those things,

75
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:39,138
and you think, "It doesn't matter."

76
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,707
Then the next day,

77
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:44,177
you stop caring that you
forgot in the first place.

78
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:48,177
And before long, you realize all
you have in common is the routine.

79
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:59,192
And since I've been obsessed
with Ferlinghetti for a year,

80
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,760
I decided to try poetry.

81
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,130
So, I'm writing a piece
for a poetry slam this week.

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,165
What's a poetry slam?

83
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:10,165
It's sort of like a concert,
but with poems instead of songs.

84
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,640
Think hip-hop meets the Beat poets.

85
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,642
You know, Ginsberg and Kerouac.

86
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,177
Oh, yeah, I totally love them.

87
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:21,581
The art house in Hillcrest
is playing On the Road.

88
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:25,385
From the novel. You know, by Kerouac.

89
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:27,887
Oh, right.

90
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:32,425
- You want to check it out with me?
- Ok.

91
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,604
Having fun?

92
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,606
It's kind of a weird party.

93
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:39,442
Yeah, my moms have a lot of weird friends.

94
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:42,245
- I mean, everybody's nice.
- Hey.

95
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,683
Hey, what's he doing here?

96
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,518
I invited him.

97
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:54,524
Wow, this is quite the rager.

99
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,259
Lighten up, dude. I'm kidding.

100
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,661
Yeah, I know. Just don't call me dude.

101
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,272
Did you get enough to eat, Jude?

102
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,040
Yeah.

103
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:09,114
Ok, see this is a dry dish.

104
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:12,250
- And this is me not caring.
- Watch your mouth, young man.

105
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,820
What? If you like how he
does it so much better,

106
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,155
he can come over every night and do it.

107
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:21,993
So, Jenna told me that Garret
is doing some poetry slam.

108
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:24,096
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,997
I was thinking, maybe we could all go

110
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,649
if he makes it to performance round.

111
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,053
It'd be a nice break from
volleyball and television...

112
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,654
Might even learn something.

113
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:35,023
- I'm in.
- Ooh, learning. Cool.

114
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,993
- Wow.
- I'll go.

115
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:40,028
Not your thing?

116
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,665
No, no, just... yeah, it's not my thing.

117
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:46,802
Well, it's your choice, but
we'd love to have you join us.

118
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:50,505
If it's ok, I think I'm just gonna pass.

119
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:53,141
Ok, manual labor's done.

120
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,811
I got to get home. Thank
you, guys, for a fun night.

121
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,980
- Thank you for helping us.
- Very nice to meet you, Wyatt.

122
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,481
- Pleasure.
- Ok.

123
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,387
- Yeah, nice to meet you, Wyatt.
- You, too, big guy. See you.

124

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
akumenang.com

125
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,622
All right.

126
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,091
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

127
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,564
Hey, what are you doing with that guy?

128
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,067
That guy is the only
person I've met at school

129
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,635
who isn't completely freaked out by me.

130
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,205
Just be careful with him.

131
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,609
What's that supposed to mean?

132
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,546
- He used to date Talya.
- So?

133
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,682
It's not that. I mean...

134
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,984
Ok, he was really into her for awhile,

135
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,485
then he convinced her to have sex with him.

136
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,121
- Yeah?
- And then he dumped her.

137
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:30,121
The next day. Just trust
me, he's not a good guy.

138
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,032
Isn't it Jesus's week to help with laundry?

139
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,034
Yeah, I told him not to bother.

140
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,008
The last time he did
it my white linen pants

141
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,543
came out of the dryer as pink capris.

142
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,578
Yeah.

143
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:50,417
So, Jenna told me that she
and Kelly may be splitting up.

144
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,220
What? No way. What? You're kidding.

145
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,924
I know. Jenna said they
haven't had sex in over a year.

146
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,593
Oh, dear.

147
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:03,230
That is a long time to let it go, isn't it.

148
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,398
How long has it been for us?

149
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:08,102
Uh, it was last...

150
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:10,170
If you have to think about
it, it's been too long.

151
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,406
Sweetheart, what do you expect?

152
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:15,442
We have jobs, five kids,
and no cleaning person.

153
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,945
Can't expect things to be
the way they used to be.

154
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:20,114
They shouldn't be this different.

155
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:23,284
Let's have a date night.
You know, like we used to.

156
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:27,284
With cocktails, and dinner,
and then other stuff...

157
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:31,225
Mm-hm. You think we
have time for all that?

158
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:33,065
- How about just the "other stuff" part?
- I can handle that.

159
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:35,200
Let me check my phone.

160
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:39,071
Let's see.

161
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,853
- Tomorrow's not great.
- Why?

162
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:41,485
Jude has his tutor and you have to take

163
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:42,753
Brandon to his dentist appointment.

164
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,554
No, I thought you were taking Brandon.

165
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:46,690
No, I can't. I have to talk to
the tutor about Jude's mid-terms.

166
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,059
Ok, how about this? How about...

167
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,529
You leave work early, I will take a
late lunch. The house will be empty.

168
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,798
And there will be no kids to worry about.

169
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,634
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

170
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:01,634
Do we have any antacids? Your
chimichangas are killing me...

171
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,479
What time are your parents coming home?

172
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,847
Not for hours.

173
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,987
- Are you ok?
- I'm great, I just...

174
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,789
Just need a little break.

175
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,724
We don't have to stop.

176
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:22,626
Really?

177
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,745
I like that color.

178
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,513
Are you sure it's not too much?

179
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,650
I'm going for the "I'm being
carelessly casual but just happen

180
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,752
to be fabulous" look for my date tonight.

181
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,086
It's pretty.

182
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,556
Do you want me to do yours?

183
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:56,659
- Come on, let me do yours too.
- Ok.

184
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:03,165
So, anything new and
exciting in your world?

185
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,534
Made any new friends?

186
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:08,370
Well, there is this one boy.

187
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,306
- Oh?
- His name is Connor,

188
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,107
and we have math class together.

189
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:15,211
- What's he like?
- I don't know. He's pretty cool.

190
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:23,786
Uh, don't wear that to school. Ok, buddy?

191
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:30,826
You don't have to do
everything she says, you know...

192
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,767
What happened with you and Talya?

193
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,125
My night was great.

194
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,428
And yes, this is a new
shirt, thanks for noticing.

195
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:48,931
- It does bring out my eyes.
- Everything's not a joke.

196
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,567
Ok, wow, you're going
for this direct thing.

197
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,204
This is Brandon, right? He told you this?

198
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,825
Talya and I,

199
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,060
we hung out, she seemed chill,

200
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,097
I liked her, and we had sex.

201
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,800
And that's supposed to make you,
what exactly? Feel like a real man?

202
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,970
You wanted to know what happened.
I'm just giving you the full story.

203
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,473
As soon as we did it, she changed.

204
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,075
She got all weird and controlling.

205
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,112
In case you haven't noticed,
that's not really my thing.

206
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,482
So, after a couple weeks, I let
her know I wasn't into it anymore.

207
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,951
So, you didn't break up
with her the next day?

208
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,755
I did not. Everyone thinks
she's one of those nice girls,

209
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,056
she's actually kind of crazy.

210
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,993
Ah... sorry.

211
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,629
Apology not accepted.

212
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,932
What?

213
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,453
If you think you can just attack me...

214
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:43,423
- Wasn't an attack.
- ... and say you're sorry and it's all better?

215
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:47,060
Mm-mm. I'm not some pushover who
takes a hit and comes back for more.

216
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,995
You're going to have to make it up to me.

217
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:51,364
Tomorrow night.

218
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:53,066
And do what?

219
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,268
I don't know yet.

220
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:58,004
Well, I'll have to ask Lena and Stef.

221
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,606
They'll say yes.

222
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:01,408
So, you're confident.

223
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:04,978
Well, I didn't stick
around and dry their dishes

224
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:08,114
just because I like cleaning
up after other people.

225
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:10,317
See you tomorrow.

226
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:13,653
It was not.

227
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:16,433
I swear, it was a 55-pound white seabass.

228
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,902
My dad weighed it. It was crazy big.

229
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:21,872
- You fish?
- I've never even been on a boat.

230
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,341
How do you grow up by the
beach but never get on a boat?

231
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,909
You have to come next
time my dad takes me out.

232
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,779
- Really?
- Wait, I forgot my book.

233
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:33,483
- Nice nails.
- You wearing a bra, too?

234
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,318
Why don't you guys just grow up?

235
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,387
What'd you just say?

236
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,994
I said grow up, idiot.

237
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:47,164
- Who're you calling an idiot?
- What's going on here?

238
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:50,333
Blake, Jeremy. Principal's office. Now.

239
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:02,879
Hey. Brought you something.

240
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:07,017
They had the good ones
in the cafeteria today.

241
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,486
I know you like them, so...

242
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,488
Thanks.

243
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:14,091
Are you ok?

244
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,426
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,328
You sure?

246
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,397
What if I get pregnant?

247
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,299
- That's not going to happen.
- You don't know that.

248
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,234
My parents...

249
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:26,303
my parents would kill me.

250
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:43,019
Yes, I need a morning-after pill, please.

251
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,426
Thanks.

252
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:53,263
Hi. I'm picking up for
my son, Jesus Foster.

253
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,198
And this, please.

254
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,338
Hey!

255
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,807
What is going on?

256
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,020
- Lena?
- Upstairs!

257
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,956
Uh, I am here with Jesus.

258
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,625
Could you come down for a minute, please?

259
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,159
Why is Mom home so early?

260
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,396
You are not in a position
to be asking questions.

261
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,265
Hey, what's going on?

262
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,003
Last night, I...

263
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,209
last night, Lexi and I had sex.

264
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,612
Oh, my God.

265
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,447
Ok...

266
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,384
And?

267
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,955
And we didn't use protection.

268
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,958
How many times have we talked about this?

269
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,094
I know, but it... just sort of happened.

270
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,349
And then it was too late.

271
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,219
Well, we needed the morning-after pill,

272
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:01,788
but I guess you have to have ID to buy it.

273
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:04,724
Neither of us have ID, so...

274
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:08,328
I asked some lady at the
pharmacy to get the pill for us.

275
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,797
And that's when Mom found me.

276
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,843
Jesus, how many ways do we
have to tell you to come to us?

277
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,845
Why didn't you come to us?

278
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,747
To avoid this.

279
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,917
I don't know what to say.

280
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,853
So, can I give it to her?

281
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:26,890
Your mom and I need to talk about
this. Please go to your room.

282
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,501
I know it was stupid, but Lexi
thought it was the only thing to do.

283
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:42,038
- Why?
- She's afraid her parents are going to find out and freak.

284
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,982
We did everything we were supposed to do...

285
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:54,584
open dialogue, no stigmatizing,

286
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,771
no fear based warnings. We even
put condoms in their bathroom.

287
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,239
We can't blame ourselves, honey.

288
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,642
I know, I know. I'm just...

289
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:04,611
- Really disappointed.
- I know.

290
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,747
So, now what?

291
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,982
- We give her the pill.
- What about her parents?

292
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:14,151
What about her parents.

293
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:15,686
If this were Mariana,
we would want to know.

294
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,588
We can't go making decisions
for other people's kids.

295
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:21,091
Ok, what if she gets pregnant, Lena?

296
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:24,461
You know how religious her parents are.

297
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,630
They're certainly not
going to let her terminate.

298
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,042
They're going to want them to get married.

299
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,778
Do you want Jesus to be
married and a father at 15?

300
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:33,214
Please quit reminding me that they're 15.

301
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:37,218
- Well, they are.
- There's always adoption.

302
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,353
I... do you really want
them to go through that?

303
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,756
- 'Cause I got to tell you...
- I have a responsibility here.

304
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:45,159
I am her vice principal.

305
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,928
And I am not.

306
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:50,131
Can we just take a beat, please?

307
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:52,133
This is not the kind of thing we act on

308
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,835
without thinking it through first.

309
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,104
I'm going to go get dressed.

310
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,060
You didn't like it, did you.

311
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,996
Of course, I liked it.

312
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,931
On the Road is like a classic.

313
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,933
It's just... I don't know,

314
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,435
I feel like everyone was kind of selfish,

315
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,739
and just angry and didn't
care about anyone else.

316
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,874
They had a lot to be angry about.

317
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:17,975
They were looking for answers and

318
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,810
no one else was even asking the questions.

319
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,147
Ok, I guess I didn't like it.

320
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:26,884
Maybe next time we can
go see The Lone Ranger.

321
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,421
So, you want to come inside?

322
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,952
We can, I don't know,
watch TV or something.

323
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,591
TV's not really my thing.

324
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,846
Besides, I got to meet up with a friend.

325
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,781
I promised I'd help her rehearse a poem

326
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:38,950
for the first round of the Slam tomorrow.

327
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,018
The second round's
supposed to be a big to-do.

328
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
But, thanks for a fun time.

329
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,924
- Yeah, sure.
- See you later.

330
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,293
No, I'm serious.

331
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,863
It's like he didn't
even know it was a date.

332
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,032
Maybe he didn't. Why do you care anyway?

333
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,668
Well, we're not all as lucky as you.

334
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,804
You just got here, you don't even try,

335
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,772
and you already have a boyfriend.

336
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,609
Wyatt, not a boyfriend.

337
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,008
He sure seems like a boyfriend.

338
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,309
Look, if Garret wants to hang out

339
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:11,646
with some alternative
poetry girls, let him.

340
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,481
Besides, do you really want to date a guy

341
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,517
whose pants are tighter than yours?

342
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:19,187
They were kind of tight, huh?

343
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:26,227
How're you holding up?

344
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,329
I'm fine.

345
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,670
Do you want to talk about anything?

346
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,272
What's going on?

347
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,308
Jude just had a rough day yesterday.

348
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:42,343
Some of the kids were
giving him a hard time.

349
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,479
What happened? Are you ok?

350
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:48,249
He's fine. But, a couple of the
guys noticed his nail polish...

351
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,451
I told you not to go to
school with it on, Jude.

352
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:53,054
Go take it off. Now.

353
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:55,890
Stop telling me what to do.

354
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,996
Callie, Jude's a special kid.

355
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,065
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Lena,

356
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:06,221
but what makes him
special, gets him beat up.

357
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,157
Well, he's safe in this house.

358
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:13,094
And thank you for that, really,

359
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,264
but we're not staying here.

360
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:20,112
I don't want him to start
thinking the world is like this,

361
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:24,015
and then we move, and
then he gets even more hurt

362
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:26,785
when he figures out that it's not.

363
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,700
- Hey. Hello.
- Hey, Wyatt.

364
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,911
Oh, wait, before you go.

365
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,782
It's an old one of Stef's.
We want you to have it.

366
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,818
You're on the family plan now.

367
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:53,689
- Thanks.
- So, 10 o'clock, and not a second later.

368
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,624
- Got it?
- Got it.

369
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,793
Oh, I'm glad to hear that,
but I wasn't talking to you.

370
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:59,528
Ten o'clock.

371
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah.

372
00:20:06,735 --> 00:20:08,437
Where's she going?

373
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:10,572
On a date with Wyatt.

374
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:12,407
What about you? You got any plans?

375
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,377
Um... no.

376
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:34,629
So, when do I get to know
what we're actually doing here?

377
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,365
Wait and see.

378
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,368
Come on.

379
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,638
You have a beach house?

380
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:46,608
My parents do. Pretty much never use it.

381
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,644
Ok, what are we doing here?

382
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,346
You hear about that meteor shower tonight?

383
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:52,614
What about it?

384
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,420
Front row seats. Come on.

385
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,855
The sun's about to set.

386
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,862
May I?

387
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:17,672
You know, just a little
dab will do the trick.

388
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,541
Do you mind?

389
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:23,512
Ok.

390
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:36,591
When Stef and I are at home,

391
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:39,594
we hold hands and kiss...

392
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:41,530
Really?

393
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,566
Well, we used to do it a lot more often,

394
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,701
but we've just been really busy lately.

395
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:49,538
What does being busy have
to do with holding hands?

396
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:52,007
Ok, we're getting a little off-track here.

397
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,253
My point is,

398
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:57,790
sometimes when we're
out in a new neighborhood

399
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,790
or walking home late to our
car, we won't hold hands.

400
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,196
Why?

401
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:07,633
Some people out there

402
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:11,103
are afraid of what's different,

403
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:13,739
and sometimes they want to
hurt people like Stef and me.

404
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:17,877
So, every time we're out and
I want to hold Stef's hand,

405
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:19,211
but I decide not to?

406
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,747
I get mad.

407
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:24,491
I'm mad at the people
who might want to hurt us,

408
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:28,762
but mad at myself, too,
for not standing up to them.

409
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,185
'Cause the thing is,

410
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:34,288
if you're taught to hide
what makes you different,

411
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:38,125
you can end up feeling a lot
of shame about who you are,

412
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,896
and that's not ok.

413
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:45,696
There's nothing wrong with
you for wearing nail polish,

414
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:50,801
just like there's nothing wrong
with me for holding Stef's hand.

415
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:55,416
What's wrong is the people out
there who make us feel unsafe.

416
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,697
It's beautiful.

417
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,377
You mean that dense layer of clouds

418
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,479
that's keeping us from seeing anything

419
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,681
or the loud plane that keeps flying over?

420
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,586
- Well, you tried.
- I tried.

421
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,488
Valiant effort.

422
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,826
You have an eye booger.

423
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,296
Oh, my God... seriously?

424
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:31,366
No, I'm just making it up to
make you feel good about yourself.

425
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,801
- Other side.
- All right...

426
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,838
It's still there, you just moved it.

427
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,873
- Ok.
- I'll get it.

428
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:54,589
I thought you said your
parents never use the house.

429
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:56,991
Yeah, this isn't my house. We got to go.

430
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,242
What the hell was that?

431
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,978
I did a construction job
at that house last summer.

432
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,980
I really thought they only
used the place on weekends.

433
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,515
Are you freakin' kidding me?

434
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,551
I'm on probation! You understand
what could have happened

435
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:14,221
- if they caught us?
- I'm sorry...

436
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,089
I was just trying to impress you.

437
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,891
Well, congratulations.

438
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:21,261
I'm blown away by your utter lack
of regard for anyone but yourself.

439
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,399
I have to be home in a half hour.

440
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,973
Good luck getting through the
police barricade to get to my car.

441
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,144
It's too soon?

442
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:03,103
Hey.

443
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:06,240
And wisps of dirty hair
cling to your angry face

444
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,843
There is a tiny bit of mustard
burrowed in the crack of your frown

445
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:13,213
And this is when I know
And this is when it changes

446
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,449
And this is the way I will remember you

447
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:21,889
You seriously did great.
Like, Andrea Gibson great.

448
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,323
I couldn't have done it without you.

449
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,229
Hey, what are you doing here?

450
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:33,333
Um, I'm performing.
You kind of inspired me.

451
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,603
Oh, ok. That's great.

452
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,207
I'm sorry. Mariana, this is Savannah.

453
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,243
Savannah, this is Mariana.
She's a friend of my family.

454
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,916
I like your outfit, and
your poem was really cool.

455
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,884
Oh. Thanks.

456
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,994
Mom.

457
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,430
I'm guessing you're not here
for a little mother-son time?

458
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,133
Did you guys decide about the pill yet?

459
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,104
We're still thinking, Jesus.

460
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:14,308
Ok, but, Lexi's kind of
freaking out, because...

461
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:17,411
Well, it's called the morning-after
pill for a reason, you know?

462
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,246
Yes. I know.

463
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,294
This is one of those things
we'll laugh about tomorrow.

464
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,330
It's unlikely.

465
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:37,598
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

466
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:38,980
Thanks for bailing us out, bro.

467
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:40,358
I'm not your bro.

468
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,950
Blooming like a rose in spring

469
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,686
Blossoming like an Easter lily

470
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:52,686
Your smile is a flower on
the garden of your face.

471
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,660
Woo!

472
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,665
That was really nice.

473
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:05,069
- Thanks.
- All right.

474
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,770
Thank you so very much for coming.

475
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,607
We're impressed. So, for
tomorrow's round-two performance,

476
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:10,975
we'd like to use...

477
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,944
Matt DeVry, Alice Lewis,

478
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:17,944
Gabriella DuPont, Savannah
George, and Mo Peters...

479
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,386
and closing the night
out will be Garret Paul.

480
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:23,788
Let's give all the performers a hand.

481
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:25,890
Thanks for coming out.

482
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,894
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

483
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:32,063
Closing the show, huh? Nice.

484
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,000
Excuse me. Hi...

485
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was just wondering if you could
tell me why I didn't make it?

486
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:42,907
You know, so I can be better
prepared for next time.

487
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:44,208
This is your first performance, right?

488
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,947
You did an amazing job, really.

489
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:51,149
We're just looking for something different.

490
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:55,186
A little more raw, you
know? But you'll get there.

491
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:15,373
- Hey, I said I was sorry.
- And I said it was ok.

492
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:18,476
- Why are you acting so mad?
- You really have to ask?

493
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:21,279
You just had me pick you
up on a date with Wyatt!

494
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,914
Why do you hate Wyatt so much?

495
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,350
This isn't even about Wyatt.

496
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,052
Ok?

497
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,854
I don't want you dating Wyatt

498
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:33,257
because I don't want you dating anyone.

499
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:40,898
I can't...

500
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:43,968
- I can't do this.
- Well, too bad.

501
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:45,580
Even having this conversation could

502
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,981
get me and Jude kicked out of the house.

503
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,751
- That would never happen.
- You don't know that.

504
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:53,822
Two years ago, Jude and I were
in a really good foster home.

505
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:56,725
Definitely the best before coming here.

506
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:59,861
And they had a son.

507
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:02,430
And he was really nice to me.
So, we started hanging out.

508
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,799
And then the parents found out.

509
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,036
And he told them it was my fault,

510
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:10,939
I was coming on to him.

511
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,441
And the next day,

512
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,811
the next day, they had
me and Jude sent away.

513
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,715
And the parents told CPS some excuse.

514
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:23,512
They didn't want to admit
that their son was having

515
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,814
a relationship with the trashy foster girl.

516
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,951
So, yeah, Brandon. It can happen...

517
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,654
because it already did.

518
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:37,993
I'm not like him. I would never do that.

519
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:44,295
It doesn't matter. It
still ends the same way.

520
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:04,091
Admit it, you want me to apologize.

521
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,894
I don't, because it doesn't matter.

522
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:10,464
No, you do want me to
apologize so you can forgive me

523
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:14,335
and everything can go back
to normal because you like me.

524
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:18,439
So I like you because you're
reckless and presumptuous?

525
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,341
That's interesting.

526
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,876
You're not as good of a
liar as you think you are.

527
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:26,547
Look, I've done a lot of
stupid things in my life,

528
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:30,384
I haven't regretted any
of it, until last night.

529
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:32,119
I should not have done what I did.

530
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,655
I regret it. And I'm sorry.

531
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,558
So, how long are you going
to leave me hanging here?

532
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,365
We good?

533
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:49,858
Come on, it's not like
I'm asking you to marry me.

534
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:53,858
Just give me another chance, all right?

535
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:08,258
You ok?

536
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:10,713
These lips take a while to process, I know.

537
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,081
I'm fine.

538
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,626
Are you sure you're ok?

539
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:59,829
I'm not feeling great, but I'm ok. Yeah.

540
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,798
But, this... all of this is too much.

541
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:09,138
I think we need to...

542
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:12,909
well, stop doing what we did.
At least for a little while.

543
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:15,511
And if that means you don't like me...

544
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:17,613
Hey, hey.

545
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:21,651
I like you. I'm not going anywhere, ok?

546
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,941
Hey.

547
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,878
Want half? Their peanut
butter is all weird and oily

548
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:36,349
but it's still pretty
good if you add sugar.

549
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:39,185
Why are you still wearing that?

550
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,887
Because I like it.

551
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:44,223
Well, take it off before
you get a black eye to match.

552
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,162
- No.
- What?

553
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,331
I'm not taking it off.

554
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,899
You want to get beat up again?

555
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,867
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

556
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:59,205
Look, I know it's easy
to feel comfortable here,

557
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,774
but this isn't our home.

558
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,910
You shouldn't get too
invested in these people.

559
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,346
Why not? Don't you want a family?

560
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:10,346
- I have a family.
- It's not...

561
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,386
I like them. They're nice.

562
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:16,255
And maybe it's not forever, but so what?

563
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,757
You're going to get hurt.

564
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:20,526
I already hurt.

565
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,269
Sorry to bother you. Do you have a minute?

566
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,438
Of course. Come on in.

567
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,911
Have a seat.

568
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,482
What's up?

569
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:47,186
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.

570
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,856
You and Stef have been
a second family to me.

571
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:52,892
Have you thought any more
about talking to your mom?

572
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:56,892
Oh. No, I can't. She'd lose it.

573
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:02,135
I mean, if she ever found out
that you guys gave me the pill,

574
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,871
she'd go crazy.

575
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:07,807
My mom can get so mad.

576
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,546
Your mom's not the only one.

577
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,381
Ok...

578
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,517
I just wanted to say thank you.

579
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,853
- You'll tell Stef for me?
- Oh, I definitely will.

580
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,500
Were you going to tell me?

581
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,970
I was, when you got home.
Can we please talk in here.

582
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,506
Well, instead I had to
learn from a 15 year old girl

583
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,207
that my partner went behind my back.

584
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,777
I'm sorry, but I knew
you felt a responsibility

585
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,379
to Lexi's parents because
you're her vice principal.

586
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:54,449
I did it so you did not have to.

587
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:56,885
- How generous.
- That's not productive.

588
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:59,087
We make decisions about
our children together.

589
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,322
Yes, absolutely we do.

590
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:04,859
But waiting to make a decision could
have made our son a father at 15.

591
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,196
I knew you were in an awkward
position. I was very careful.

592
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:09,864
I talked her through everything,

593
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:13,134
and I made sure she knew
this was a last resort.

594
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,336
Tell me you're not relieved, Lena.

595
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,810
Hey, we've been waiting
for you. We got to go...

596
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,045
We're gonna be late. Everybody
please come downstairs.

597
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,747
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

598
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:31,152
Where's Mariana?

599
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:33,721
Probably sticking pins
in a voodoo doll of Lexi.

600
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:36,191
- Hey, cool it. You owe us.
- I'm sorry.

601
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:38,726
Yeah, cool it...

602
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:39,994
Who you telling to cool it?

603
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,796
Will you go get her, please?

604
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:44,299
- Why do I have to go?
- Because you're our favorite.

605
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:49,737
Hey... is it too late for me to tag along?

606
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:51,406
No, of course not. We'd love it.

607
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,811
Mariana, you in there?

608
00:36:56,811 --> 00:36:58,313
Mariana?

609
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:03,718
Moms are going to kill you.

610
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,423
Nice of you to join us, Miss Thing.

611
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:15,463
What happened to your face?

612
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:20,101
- Do you like it?
- No, I don't like it.

613
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,872
- Did it hurt?
- Sort of.

614
00:37:23,872 --> 00:37:25,440
Of course it hurt. You
punched a hole in your face.

615
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,776
Ok, enough. We'll deal with you later.

616
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:30,178
Let's go. Everybody in the car.

617
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:33,481
What is happening?

618
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:40,221
What's happening?

619
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,036
Last Tuesday night,

620
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:57,505
my mother Jenna comes into the house

621
00:37:57,505 --> 00:38:01,175
I'm sitting in the living
room with my other mom, Kelly.

622
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:06,944
Jenna asks us if we'll take a drive
with her, so we all get in the car.

623
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,850
And as we drive, silence creeps along
like the cracks in a frozen lake.

624
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:16,724
Our hearts begin to thud slowly,

625
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,760
off beat.

626
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,764
And I wonder and then I know.

627
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:25,366
And I didn't imagine
it would end like this.

628
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:27,302
I didn't imagine an ending at all,

629
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:29,504
but if they were going to
tell me about the divorce,

630
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:31,439
what a way to do it.

631
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,141
I sit in the backseat and think about

632
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:35,310
how lucky we were to have had this family.

633
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,214
Their 20 years of
marriage, my 15 with them.

634
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:43,084
I remember all of us, driving
for miles out on the highway

635
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:45,153
until I fell asleep in the backseat.

636
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:48,256
I don't want this life to
end, Jenna starts to talk.

637
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:51,359
She tells me that our car

638
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,359
is just 13 miles away from
reaching 100,000 miles now.

639
00:38:56,698 --> 00:39:00,168
I wonder if this is part of the
divorce speech or just a distraction.

640
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,704
I feel angry, they should just say it.

641
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:06,307
She tells me the reason we took this ride

642
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:10,307
is so that we could all be there
to reach 100,000 miles together,

643
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,616
as the people who matter in her life.

644
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:18,616
Slowly, I realize that
this isn't a breakup ride

645
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:23,358
or a divorce ride, or a separation ride.

646
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,141
This is a 100,000 mile ride.

647
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:31,945
We're in the car, and we're
driving on a Tuesday night,

648
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:35,115
and we're 99,987 miles in.

649
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:38,151
We stop for onion rings
and sundaes, keep driving.

650
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:42,122
99,993 miles, Stevie Nicks.

651
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:45,592
99,997 miles, Elton John.

652
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,592
When we get to 999,999 miles we hold hands,

653
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:55,031
blast Melissa Etheridge, and sing
Lucky at the top of our lungs.

654
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:59,289
There are too many reasons that my mamas
found love in each other's presence.

655
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:04,064
There are too many moments
when we are unbreakable,

656
00:40:04,064 --> 00:40:07,101
and in this moment, we are one family.

657
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:10,591
Constructing road as we go,
burning bridges behind us,

658
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,827
adding mileage like graceful aging.

659
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,827
Driving in our car towards moonlight.

660
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:23,804
All right, Garret! Woo!

661
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,580
Hey. Congrats. You
totally blew everyone away.

662
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,115
Aw, thanks.

663
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:36,083
At least we got the happy
ending for one night.

664
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,685
What do you mean?

665
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,187
My moms are splitting up.
They don't think I know.

666
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:44,187
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry...
- Me, too.

667
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,931
- What's up with the face art?
- You like?

668
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,601
Yeah, why'd you do it?

669
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,870
I don't know. Just trying something new.

670
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,872
You know, a little edgier.

671
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,273
You don't have to try so hard.

672
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:01,342
You're already pretty great.

673
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,954
Will be in in a minute, you guys.

674
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,159
So, they're really getting a divorce?

675
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,694
They really are.

676
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,862
Oh, my God. I can't imagine.

677
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,965
- Thank God.
- What?

678
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,633
I mean, "Thank God you can't imagine."

679
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,768
- Mm.
- I can't either.

680
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:31,739
I thought they would be
together forever, you know...

681
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,742
I guess everybody thinks
that when they start a family.

682
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:41,082
I'm sorry about the way
I handled the pill thing.

683
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,652
- Not the giving it part...
- Thank you.

684
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,957
I'm sorry I forgot to buy your guacamole.

685
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,261
- You really are a saint.
- Pretty much.

686
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,964
- A hot saint.
- Really?

687
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,065
Oh, yeah.

688
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,174
- Wait, we can't do this.
- Why not?

689
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,110
The kids are right inside.

690
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,212
They're going to come
looking for us? Please.

691
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,794
Why don't we take this
somewhere more comfortable?

692
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,964
Ok... hold up, my foot's stuck.

693
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,566
Stop! Sh...

694
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:42,154
