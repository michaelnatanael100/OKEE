Homestay (2018)
Subtitle by: FJ12

2
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,041
Can you hear me?
You...

3
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,041
got a prize.

4
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,708
Time to go.

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,708
Right now!

6
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,250
Min.

7
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,458
Min.

8
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,375
Min.

9
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,500
Where are you going?

10
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,583
Where are you running off to?

11
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,291
Congratulations.

12
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,625
Don't you remember?

13
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,625
Whoa!

14
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,958
Hello.

15
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,500
Afraid?

16
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,250
Stay still and listen.

17
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,208
Is this real?

18
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,875
"Is this real?"

19
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,166
Ouch!

20
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Does it hurt?

21
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,458
If it hurts...

22
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,916
then it's real.

23
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,083
Then...

24
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,000
why can't I remember anything?

25
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,541
Because all your damn memories have been erased.

26
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Can't help it.

27
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,125
It's a condition of the prize.

28
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,708
Prize?

29
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,125
This body?

30
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,666
Yeah.

31
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,166
This body...

32
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,583
is the prize for a soul like you...

33
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,291
to use to live again.

34
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,708
And...

35
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,041
are you one of them who sent me here?

36
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,250
You're so darn curious, huh?

37
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,541
Yeah!

38
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,958
I'm your Guardian.

39
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,041
Guardian?

40
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:19,958
Guarding what?

41
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,083
Lie on your stomach.

42
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,333
Huh?

43
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,083
Hurry!

44
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,750
I said to lie on your stomach!

45
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,500
Face down!

46
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,833
Hold on tightly!

47
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,291
Hold on tight!

48
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,583
Hold your grip.

49
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,416
Shh...

50
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,083
If you fall this time,

51
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,083
you'll die for real.

52
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,541
It'll hurt a bit.

53
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,291
Shit!

54
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,958
So?

55
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,791
Are you used to this body?

56
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:23,958
Guardian?

57
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,083
Can you be just anyone?

58
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,375
Do you like this Homestay?

59
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,291
Homestay?

60
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,291
Don't you know?

61
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,625
Huh?

62
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,000
This body is only temporary.

63
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,416
Tick-tock.

64
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,208
Tick-tock.

65
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,833
This hourglass counts backwards on your life.

66
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,333
You have 100 days...

67
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,208
to find out who caused Min to kill himself.

68
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,166
And what if I can't?

69
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,250
You'll die.

70
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,541
And your soul won't ever be reborn.

71
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,875
Bummer.

72
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,583
Oh.

73
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,791
Don't let anyone know...

74
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,291
that you're not Min.

75
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,958
Hey! Hold on.

76
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,583
Enjoy the 98 days you have left.

77
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,875
Can you remember what happened?

78
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,083
Do you feel anything wrong?

79
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,458
No, sir.

80
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,291
Can you remember your name?

81
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,250
Min, sir.

82
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,208
Your first name?

83
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,250
Taradon Chandrasen, sir.

84
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,916
You know you were dead for one full night?

85
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,416
I've been a doctor for 20 years,

86
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,750
I've never seen anything like this.

87
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,041
You survived.

88
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
I'll take it as a good sign then.

89
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:27,291
Next time you do anything, think about it carefully.

90
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,583
May I speak with you outside, please?

91
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,041
Okay.

92
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,750
Mr Taradon Chandrasen

93
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,750
Min.

94
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,250
Yes?

95
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,000
Min, come sit here.

96
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,083
Min.

97
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,583
For now...

98
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,291
I'm asking you...

99
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,916
to sleep in Menn's room.

100
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,291
I don't want you to sleep alone just yet.

101
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:46,833
Sure.

102
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,583
As for your clothes...

103
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,916
you'll have to wear Menn's for now.

104
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,333
I'll get you some new ones tomorrow.

105
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,208
Thank you.

106
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,916
Tomorrow, I'll stay at a friend's.

107
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:01,791
Menn.

108
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,083
Mum.

109
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,250
Huh?

110
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,625
The day I committed suicide,

111
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,208
what happened?

112
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,583
What's done is done, hon.

113
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,500
Forget it.

114
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,458
Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

115
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,083
Hello professor.

116
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,791
Vitamins?

117
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,666
Let me check real quick, sir.

118
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,250
I have about a dozen left.

119
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,500
Yes, sir.

120
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,458
Okay.

121
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,958
I quit teaching.

122
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,041
I'm doing this full time.

123
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,916
What are you doing?

124
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,875
Is this my room?

125
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,125
Why's it locked?

126
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,375
Mum said to sleep in my room.

127
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,250
Just go!

128
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,416
Mr Taradon Chandrasen : 2001 - 2018

129
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,208
Shit!

130
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,291
What are you doing?

131
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,541
Are you going to do it again?

132
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,250
No.

133
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,291
I...

134
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,583
I just want to get into my room.

135
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,000
And...

136
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,250
what's happened to all my stuff?

137
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,500
Don't talk like that.

138
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,625
You're the one who got rid of them.

139
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,166
Min.

140
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,958
Can you tell me...

141
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,416
why did you do that?

142
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,500
The day...

143
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,416
I saw you lying here...

144
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,208
all I thought was...

145
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,458
that you fainted.

146
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,791
That you would be okay.

147
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:10,541
Until...

148
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,083
the doctor told me

149
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,416
you weren't here anymore.

150
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,458
You were gone.

151
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,875
Don't do it again, hon.

152
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,916
Taradon Chandrasen

153
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,541
Ruedee Chandrasen

154
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,250
064-081-4658.

155
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,541
Umm...

156
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,166
1 4 and what?

157
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,416
6 5 8.

158
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:07,833
6 5 8.

159
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,166
Can't you remember my number?

160
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,958
Dad will pick you up at 5.

161
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,291
I have to go back to the factory in Rayong.

162
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,333
I've taken so many days off.

163
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,250
Okay.

164
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,083
Oh, Min.

165
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
About your absence...

166
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,958
I told your teacher that you had the flu.

167
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,208
If anyone asks...

168
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,708
Tell them I had the flu, right?

169
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,375
Grade 11 Room 1

170
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,833
Taradon.

171
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,416
Taradon.

172
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,541
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,916
Don't go anywhere at noon.

174
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,166
Stay for last term's exams.

175
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:07,625
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,583
Is this a monk's alms bowl?

177
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,208
Why don't you add dessert too?

178
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,083
I thought you were freakin' dead.

179
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,166
You didn't show up for finals,

180
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,541
and at the start of term either.

181
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,208
What the hell's wrong with you?

182
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,208
You got leukemia?

183
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,958
I had the damn flu.

184
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,416
What's with the swearing!

185
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,125
I'm sorry, Miss.

186
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,583
What the hell now?

187
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,791
Cheeky.

188
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,166
I'm better now.

189
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,666
Pi was asking about you.

190
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,083
She said she couldn�t reach you.

191
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,333
Pi?

192
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,625
Yeah. Happy?

193
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,208
Hey...

194
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,250
we're close, right?

195
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:37,125
What's with the damn smile?

196
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,458
You're scaring me.

197
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,416
Been taking your dad's vitamins?

198
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,833
The Power Rangers are calling a meeting.

199
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,541
Let's go!

200
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:54,791
Hurry!

201
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:55,875
Power Rangers!

202
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,416
Power Rangers?
Yeah, c'mon!

203
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,291
Hurry!

204
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,125
Min!

205
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,208
Don't you love this club?

206
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,333
Working like this.

207
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,208
Fine.

208
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,666
We'll take care of it.

209
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:14,916
Work harder.

210
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,083
Just 3 months left.

211
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:18,708
Li.

212
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,125
I really wanna know,

213
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,416
did you follow up on your friend's work?

214
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,333
If the drawings aren't finished,

215
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,875
others can't finish their jobs.

216
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,583
They're the Power Rangers?

217
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,875
What damn Power Rangers?!

218
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,375
Are you mocking us?

219
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,583
Min, where have you been?

220
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,416
You didn't come during school break.

221
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:42,750
Umm...

222
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,416
Here, take a look.

223
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,541
Shit!

224
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,458
Oops.

225
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,916
How emo are you gonna be?

226
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,000
I told you I don't want this crap.

227
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,916
I drew all these?

228
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,541
Ask yourself.

229
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,166
The locker's full of them.

230
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,083

231

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,791
Draw nicely for once.

233
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,666
I want to see your drawing used.

234
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,625

235
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,375

240
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,041
Umm...

241
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,333
I...

242
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,125
Whose pin is that?

243
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,541
You're not an Olympics student.

244
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:48,458
See you in the evening at the library.

245

00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,208
Besides Physics,

249
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,791

00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,500
Take a look.

253
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,250
So?

254
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,500
Aren't you really gonna tell me

255
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:50,791
where you've been?

256
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,291
I was in hospital.

257
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:56,958
What's wrong?

258
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,833
I had the flu.

259
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,583
Why didn't you call?

260
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,625
I lost my phone.

261
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,208
You're such a bad liar.

262
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,375
I'm not lying.

263
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,333
I'm sorry for not calling you.

264
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:46,708
I was wrong.

265
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:53,916
You're smiling,

266
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,583
you aren't mad at me anymore, sis?

267
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:57,958
Being cheeky?

268
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,333
I told you not to call me sis.

269
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,958
Do you want me to be your sister?

270
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,375
I have a class to get to.

271
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,375
Do the exercises I gave you.

272
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:24,625
It will help.

273
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:32,750
Whoa!

274
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,333
Damn it.

281
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,708

Lookin' nice.

284
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,083
It's a good source of extra income.

285
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,666
Lots of people are doing it.

286
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,000
Dad.

287
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,666

290
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,541
Where are we going?

291
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,666
One sec.

292
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,083
Uhh...

293
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,541
It's like this.

294
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,083
Mum wants you to come.

295
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,250
Try talking to him.

296
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,333
I'm gonna visit Menn at the Engineering faculty.

297
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,916
Here, take this.

298
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,875
Give it to him and tell him

299
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,416
that I used to teach here.

300
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,375
A token of appreciation.

301
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,750
And...

302
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,666
give him my name card.

303
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,750
If he's interested, call me.

304
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,083
Who is he?

305
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,708
My dad used to teach here.

306
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,125

00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,583
Tell me.

311
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,250
How's school?

312
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:06,250
There's nothing. It's good.

313
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,541
How about friends? Any problems?

314
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,625
Nope.

315
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,041
Girls?

316
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,750
Do you get turned on being with them?

317
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:21,541
Listen.

318
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,958
If you don�t want to come here often, tell the truth.

319
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:27,583
Do you?

320
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,375
A bit.

321
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,208
Meaning, when you're with them...

322
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,208
you get an erection, right?

323
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,083
Your dick.

324
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,125
Did it get hard?

325
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,208
It did.

326
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,833
I'm feeling stronger!

327
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:41,333
You've just got here.

328
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,875
Already horny.

329
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:47,250
Are you pranking me?

330
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:50,750
You've invested.

331
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:55,666
You like it, huh?

332
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:57,791
This Homestay.

333
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,208
Yeah?

334
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:00,666
What did you find out?

335
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,458
Well...

336
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:11,750
Everyone seems okay.

337
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,333
Mum is kind.

338
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,208
Min's like a loner.

339
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,708
Repressive.

340
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,833
Maybe the brother?

341
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,708
I think he hates Min.

342
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Wanna answer now?

343
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,375
You can answer once.

344
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,083
Hey!

345
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,083
That's harsh.

346
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,583
Big prize.

347
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,083
The stakes are high.

348
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,208
So?

349
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,666
Give me a hint.

350
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:53,916
What am I?

351
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,500
Huh!

352
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:56,833
No hints.

353
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,500
I don't know either.

354
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:03,500
What?

355
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,458
How will I know if I'm right?

356
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:06,916
Simple.

357
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,083
If you're right, the hourglass will stop.

358
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,166
That's it.

359
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,791
You're enjoying his life, right?

360
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,416
But your time's running out.

361
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
68 days left

362
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,416
67 days left

363
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:31,875
Pi.

364
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:33,916
Why don't you join the party?

365
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:38,916
What's wrong?

366
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,416
The teacher...

367
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,416
gave me last-years Olympics test to do.

368
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,625
But I couldn't do it.

369
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,250
I think I won't bring back a medal.

370
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,458
I don't want to do it anymore.

371
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,541
If you don't wanna go, then don't.

372
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,083
Cannot.

373
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The teacher's already prepared everything.

374
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,375
I don't want to let anyone down.

375
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,041
So, do you wanna go or not?

376
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,708
Maybe the real reason I can't do it...

377
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,333
is because I'm too stupid.

378
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,000
Pi.

379
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,333
If you're stupid,

380
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,541
then what am I?

381
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,000
Dumbass.

382
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,333
Is this yours?

383
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:02,750
Oh, yeah.

384
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,166
I've been looking for it.

385
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,250
You found it?

386
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:09,333
Yeah.

387
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:25,958
Let me.

388
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:44,791
Pi.

389
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,041
We...

390
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,541
We're just tutoring peers?

391
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,208
We're...

392
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,500
We're not a couple?

393
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,166
We're not.

394
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,541
How could we be?

395
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,125
You've never asked me out.

396
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,750
And the last contestant...

397
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,541
Aummaraporn from the Card Stunt Club.

398
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,833
A round of applause, please!

399
00:51:57,791 --> 00:52:00,750
Loy Kratong Festival 2018

400
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,416
Whoa, lots of fans out there.

401
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,041
Whoa! So pretty!

402
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,375
Li! / Really pretty!

403
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,250
She's a woman!

404
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,500
Queen Li

405
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,166
Li, be my girlfriend!

406
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,708
Ouch! I'm dead!

407
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:37,541
Ready?

408
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:38,583
Not yet.

409
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:40,208
Be nice.

410
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:41,375
Ready?

411
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,000
Ouch!

412
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:47,625
Sorry.

413
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,208
Does it hurt?

414
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,833
It'd hurt more if you didn't join.

415
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,458
Let's go make a wish.

416
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,208
Pi.

417
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:27,833
Huh?

418
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,666
What are you wishing for?

419
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,041
Olympics?

420
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:33,458
No.

421
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,708
Something else.

422
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:45,750
What about you?

423
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,291
What are you wishing for?

424
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,083
I can't tell you.

425
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:52,750
It won't come true.

426
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:16,458
Hey!

427
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:18,916
What are you doing?

428
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:20,958
Give me. / Why?

429
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,083
You can't drink it.

430
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,958
But I want to.

431
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,458
Are you a wandering spirit?

432
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:27,291
Yeah.

433
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,041
Try it.

434
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,500
No.

435
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,958
It's sacred.

436
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,041
Nuh-uh.

437
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,833
You'll pass the test.

438
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,083
For real.

439
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:54,958
Pi.

440
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,458
Hey.

441
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,708
Pi.

442
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,083
Darn.

443
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,958
The fireworks are all gone.

444
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,291
Yeah.

445
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:34,583
Whoa!

446
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:38,958
Wow.

447
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:40,708
So beautiful.

448
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,291
They're so close.

449
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,208
It's like we can touch them.

450
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:46,791
Gosh.

451
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,291
You know...

452
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,083
today...

453
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,416
you don't seem like the Min I know.

454
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:05,375
Usually when you smile,

455
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,250
your eyes look sad.

456
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:08,500
How?

457
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,333
And...

458
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,875
which Min do you prefer?

459
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,208
Let's wait until...

460
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:38,833
you pass your exams. I'll tell you then.

461
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,750
What time did you leave this morning?

462
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,458
Did you see my ring?

463
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,083
I remember taking it off in the bathroom.

464
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,375
You sold my stuff again?

465
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,541
But it's my wedding ring.

466
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,583
Mum.

467
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,291
Oh, Min.

468
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:07,541
What are you doing?

469
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,833
Want help?

470
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:10,458
It's okay, hon.

471
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:13,250
Let me help.

472
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,125
No need. It's smelly to you.

473
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,375
Go, get out of here. It's messy.

474
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:27,250
Remember when you were a kid?

475
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,708
I pranked you with durian rinds.

476
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,541
How?

477
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,750
Hit me with them?

478
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:35,666
Crazy?

479
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,750
You were such a handful.

480
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,666
I had to raise you alone.

481
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,708
I didn't know what to do.

482
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:47,708
So, I surrounded you with the durian rinds.

483
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,916
You were very afraid.

484
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:54,125
So, you stayed in the circle.

485
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,166
You didn't dare leave.

486
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,875
I remember now.

487
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,666
And when you got a bit older,

488
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,125
I gave you some durian to eat.

489
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,125
My goodness...

490
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:10,750
you threw up.

491
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,125
You're like this...

492
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:19,958
because of me.

493
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,125
Hey, Min!

494
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:34,750
You can eat it?

495
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:35,666
Of course, I can.

496
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,708
Hold on.

497
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,708
Easy. Not so much.

498
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,500
Why not? It's good.

499
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:43,875
Really?

500
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:44,875
Really.

501
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,208
If you like it, I'll bring some more next time.

502
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,416
The best durian's from Rayong.

503
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,500
It's better than this.

504
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,458
Really?

505
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,958
It's like I got a new son.

506
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,750
Let me peel you some more.

507
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,541
I'll help you.

508
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,083
Come on.

509
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,583
So, we can go home early.

510
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,083
Hurry.

511
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,541
So, it won't be late.

512
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:21,833
28 days left

513
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,375
How's your drawing? Is it done?

514
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,625
Less than a month left.

515
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,916
Why do I have to nag you?

516
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,958
I already know.

517
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:13,500
Are you free tomorrow?

518
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,333
Let's go for shaved ice.

519
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:19,791
I've collected al the stamps.

520
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:20,625
It's free.

521
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,208
I'm meeting Pi.

522
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Let's go some other day.

523
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,458
What's with you and Pi?

524
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,041
She's my tutoring peer.

525
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,416
Stop joking.

526
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,416
I think...

527
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,875
I'll ask her to be my girl.

528
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,500
Will she like you?

529
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,125
She's an Olympics student.

530
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,166
And?

531
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,083
You don't want her to like me?

532
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:18,958
Are you done?

533
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,500
I'm gonna go upstairs.

534
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:36,500
C'mon.

535
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:43,500
Pi.

536
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,541
Whoever makes the wish is the one who does it?

537
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:50,333
But I wished for you.

538
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,583
You passed the exams, so you do it.

539
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,750
You're enjoying this.

540
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:01,625
Pi.

541
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:04,875
That's enough suds.

542
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,250
Do I really have to?

543
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:11,291
Back and forth, 10 laps.

544
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:12,791
Pi.

545
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:13,958
10 laps!

546
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,041
It's too much.

547
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,875
I'm keeping you company.

548
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:32,625
Take it!

549
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:34,958
Stop it!

550
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:39,916
There.

551
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,458
For you.

552
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:09,625
Happy birthday.

553
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:13,833
Is it my birthday?

554
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,750
Yeah.

555
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,875
Don't you remember your birthday?

556
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,750
This one's the first I've ever made.

557
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,750
It's a bit messy.

558
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:31,208
Hope it's okay.

559
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:32,750
Take a look.

560
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:43,708
It's pretty.

561
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:46,291
Fireworks!

562
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:54,291
You can see fireworks every day.

563
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,125
Thank you.

564
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,666
I like it a lot.

565
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,291
As for...

566
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,708
the question you asked during the fireworks...

567
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:22,500
I...

568
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,083
I prefer this Min.

569
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,416
What are you doing?

570
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,166
Umm...

571
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,416
I was putting away my stuff.

572
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,166
But I lost my key.

573
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,208
What stuff?

574
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,333
You can use mine.

575
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:01,750
It's okay.

576
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:02,833
Why not?

577
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,125
You left your laptop in my locker.

578
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,708
You didn't even need my permission.

579
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,208
What laptop?

580
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,333
Not yours?

581
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,416
I found this in my locker.

582
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:20,625
Li, 23 Oct. Give my mum the laptop.

583
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,291
Where is it now?

584
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,416
Did you give it to her?

585
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,125
I went to your house,

586
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,375
but I didn't see her.

587
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,833
Menn said she was at the hospital with you.

588
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:32,708
So, I gave it to him.

589
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:38,791
Didn't he tell you?

590
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:26,791
Come get your stuff. I'm leaving.

591
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:33,916
Let's break up.

592
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,083
Why didn't you show up for the scholarship interview?

593
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,375
I punched Min last night.

594
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:46,583
He ran away today.

595
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,166
Dad told me to find him.

596
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,291
So damn fed up.

597
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,416
Hey, gotta go. He's back home now.

598
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,708
I don't think I'm going to Germany anymore. Damn it.

599
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:02,583
Why? Because your parents ordered you not to go?

600
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,666
I'll call you.

601
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:07,250
You expect me to go study there alone?

602
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,500
I hate your brother. He's ruined everything.

603
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,916
Sometimes, I wish he was dead.

604
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,333
I've found his suicide letter.

605
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,666
Luckily, Mum and Dad didn't see it.

606
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,916
22 Oct 2018

607
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,916
Today is the 22nd of Oct. Age 17.

608
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,083
I've decided to commit suicide.

609
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,208
I've chosen a time and place.

610
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:03,958
Give it back.

611
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:05,916
What are you doing?

612
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:11,166
Why did you hide my suicide letter?

613
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:16,625
This shitty letter?

614
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,125
I won't let Mum read it.

615
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:21,333
Why?

616
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:24,166
Afraid Mum will know it's because of you?

617
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,041
You must be furious with me.

618
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:30,875
For not getting to study abroad.

619
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:32,916
What the hell?

620
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:37,041
You must be disappointed that I didn't die.

621
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:41,500
Yeah.

622
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,291
I wish you were dead!

623
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:47,958
Without you...

624
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,166
our family would be happier.

625
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:53,083
Hey!

626
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,166
Is this what you're looking for?

627
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:27,666
Great!

628
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:28,708
Thanks.

629
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:39,541
Oops.

630
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,000
Damn it!

631
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:45,166
Are you trying to find shortcuts?

632
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,625
Today...

633
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:23,875
is the 22nd of Oct.

634
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:25,541
Age 17.

635
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,791
I've decided to commit suicide.

636
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,416
I've chosen a time and place.

637
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,000
Tick.

638
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:34,500
Tick.

639
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:35,791
Tick.

640
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,333
The clock's started counting down.

641
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,375
Actually, I wanted to leave the laptop next to my body.

642
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,208
But I was afraid Dad and Menn would find it first.

643
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,000
You wouldn't get to read my message.

644
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,791
You're the only one I trust.

645
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,458
After you've read this letter...

646
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:24,666
you might understand

647
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,416
why I have to do this.

648
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:31,500
I want to disappear from this world.

649
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:34,625
And leave nothing behind.

650
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,666
Like I was never born.

651
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,625
I got rid of all my stuff.

652
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:46,958
They're useless anyway.

653
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,208
A dead person doesn't need them.

654
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:56,750
This family is repulsive.

655
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:00,041
Why must I be born into this family?

656
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,791
I can't tolerate living here for another day.

657
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,333
I'm so ashamed to have such a dad.

658
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,416
Damn selfish.

659
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:14,666
Quit his job to do something stupid.

660
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,541
Taking advantage of Mum.

661
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,250
I want to stuff him with those vitamins

662
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,375
to see how he'd like it.

663
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,750
Menn probably wants to be an only child.

664
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,875
I freaking hate him

665
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,041
when he looks at me...

666
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:33,750
I feel belittled.

667
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,041
Like I'm so small.

668
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,083
He must really hate me

669
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:41,291
that Mum and Dad make him live with me.

670
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:43,583
I'll die for him.

671
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,333
So, he can finally go study.

672
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:51,041
I've thought hard on how to die.

673
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,083
Actually, I want to disappear.

674
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,708
Disappear like all my stuff.

675
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:57,666
But then again...

676
01:17:58,416 --> 01:17:59,375
I'd rather not.

677
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,333
I'll die in my room.

678
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,500
I want everyone to see.

679
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:09,958
They'll probably go mad.

680
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:13,291
Too bad, I won't be here to see it.

681
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:14,875
But actually...

682
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,958
deep down, I'm afraid.

683
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:20,541
I'm afraid no one will cry.

684
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,458
But I think you will cry, Mum.

685
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,625
You will definitely cry.

686
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,291
You remember...

687
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,375
I told you I wanted to move to Rayong with you?

688
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,791
But I can't anymore.

689
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:42,708
Mum, I want to tell you...

690
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,541
I love you the most.

691
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:51,750
Mum...

692
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,000
today I stood on that bridge for so long.

693
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:57,958
I thought hard...

694
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,791
if there was anything to stop me.

695
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:05,125
But there wasn't.

696
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:07,541
Nothing at all.

697
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,000
I never wanted to go to school.

698
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,541
Until I saw Pi on the bridge that day.

699
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,250
When I started 10th grade,

700
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,541
I found out we were tutoring peers.

701
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,166
I was elated.

702
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:28,208
When we're together in the library,

703
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,583
sitting next to each other,

704
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,083
getting to see her up close,

705
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,208
everything else lost focus.

706
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,666
I forgot all my sorrow with Pi.

707
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,708
It began with that pin...

708
01:19:58,375 --> 01:19:59,416
Can I kill Pi?

709
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,416
If she doesn't die,

710
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:02,916
I'll have to die.

711
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:48,583
Prima

712
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,666
Ready.

713
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,375
1 2 3.

714
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:53,791
Okay.

715
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,583
Move back a bit.

716
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:56,708
Okay.

717
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,666
All right. That's good.

718
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:01,541
1 2 3.

719
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,958
Done.

720
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:23,916
Pi.

721
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,500
Let's talk.

722
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:30,500
Min.

723
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,208
What is it?

724
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:34,791
I'm studying.

725
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:37,875
Do you want me to talk about Mr Pat here?

726
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,041
What are you doing?

727
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:53,041
Min.

728
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,041
Don't you see that we're studying?

729
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56,291
Min.

730
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,250
Stop it!

731
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:02,666
Min.

732
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:13,416
What's with you and Mr Pat?

733
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Answer me!

734
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:22,791
Explain.

735
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:25,333
You like him?

736
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:27,583
No.

737
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:31,708
It's not what you're thinking.

738
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,958
Then what?

739
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,166
He's been so kind to me.

740
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:36,666
For real.

741
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:38,750
He's taught me everything.

742
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,416
Min.

743
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,708
I'm in the Olympics because of him.

744
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,708
Are you stupid?

745
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,958
Don't you know you're being used?

746
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,375
You're not me, you can't understand!

747
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:55,708
I'm exhausted.

748
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,041
It took a lot for me to get here.

749
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:22,958
I'm begging you.

750
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,125
Please apologise to Mr Pat.

751
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:30,625
Min.

752
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:32,625
Understand me.

753
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,625
I'm taking the Olympics exam soon.

754
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,583
Just let it be for now.

755
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,458
Is it so damn important?!

756
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,625
It's my entire world!

757
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,250
I've tried so hard.

758
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,500
You don't understand me.

759
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:54,625
You mean you don't need me?

760
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:59,250
It's not like that.

761
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,916
Min, what are you going to do?

762
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,958
Min, come over here.

763
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:05,916
Min.

764
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:11,625
Don't!

765
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,208
Min.

766
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,625
What do you want me to do?!

767
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:24,125
Are you scared?

768
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:27,958
I won't jump.

769
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,583
The person who should jump...

770
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:33,708
is you!

771
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:40,833
How can you live with yourself?

772
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,333
Look at this!

773
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,500
How lucky Mr Pat didn't go to the police.

774
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,291
What's your problem?

775
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:21,458
Can't you be normal?

776
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:29,666
Hey!

777
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:31,916
I'm talking to you. Aren't you listening?

778
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:32,791
Don't mess with me.

779
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:34,625
Look at yourself.

780
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,125
I know you sold Mum's ring.

781
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,625
How could you do that to her?!

782
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:41,625
You don't know all of it. Stop talking nonsense!

783
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:04,375
Ruedee Chandrasen

784
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,583
Industrial Residences Room 210

785
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,208
Mum.

786
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,666
Mum. It's me, Min.

787
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,708
Why are you here again?

788
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:21,833
Is there something?

789
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,291
Isn't Ms Ruedee here?

790
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,416
I already told you.

791
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,166
She doesn't stay here anymore.

792
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,000
I've been here before?

793
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,375
I don't understand.

794
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:35,125
She stays at her boyfriend's.

795
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:36,166
He's from here.

796
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,500
Aunty.

797
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,000
You remember...

798
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,583
I told you I wanted to move to Rayong with you?

799
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,375
Aunty, take me to swim.

800
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:44,000
Okay. Go ahead.

801
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,750
But I can't anymore.

802
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,500
Mum, I want to tell you...

803
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,833
I love you the most.

804
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,333
You're the only one I trust.

805
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,458
After you've read this letter...

806
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:15,791
you might understand...

807
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:20,125
why I have to do this.

808
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:48,625
Min.

809
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:51,250
Min.

810
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:54,625
Min.

811
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:12,250
Mum...

812
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:17,708
today I stood on that bridge for so long.

813
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,041
I thought hard...

814
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,458
if there was anything to stop me.

815
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:24,833
But there wasn't.

816
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,291
Nothing at all.

817
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,083
Are you going to jump?

818
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,166
It's high.

819
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:49,750
You said I got a prize.

820
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,208
This isn't a prize!

821
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,250
A damned life like this,

822
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:57,708
whoever has it would want to die too!

823
01:31:58,916 --> 01:32:00,291
Don't get carried away.

824
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:02,083
It's just a Homestay.

825
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,541
If I answer correctly,

826
01:32:06,666 --> 01:32:07,833
I can do anything, right?

827
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:11,125
I can go anywhere, right?

828
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,708
If you answer correctly,

829
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,958
this Homestay will be yours forever.

830
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,333
What you do, is your damn business.

831
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,958
I'll answer now.

832
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,708
Min died because of everyone.

833
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:23,750
Dad.

834
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:25,083
Mum.

835
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:26,583
Menn.

836
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:27,916
Pi.

837
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:31,500
Everyone's the reason.

838
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,250
How can the answer be wrong?

839
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,250
Sorry.

840
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:59,541
I'm finally done with you.

841
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,458
You have 3 days left.

842
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:03,583
Do whatever you want.

843
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:06,083
Gotta go.

844
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:07,333
Bye.

845
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,166
Min.

846
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:25,416
Min.

847
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,250
Are you in there?

848
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:29,000
Min.

849
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,000
Where the hell have you been?

850
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:34,083
You never answered my calls.

851
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,000
What's happened to your face?

852
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:39,916
Why are you here?

853
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,916
Did you finish your drawing?

854
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,833
Yours is the only one left.

855
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:49,083
It's getting close to the day.

856
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:01,916
What happened?

857
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,250
You're almost finished.

858
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:15,041
Finish it.

859
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,083
I'll turn it in for you.

860
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:22,250
Hey!

861
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:25,041
What the hell is wrong with you?

862
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,625
Did you fight with Pi?

863
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:29,666
It's none of your business.

864
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:32,375
What's wrong?

865
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,000
You can tell me.

866
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:41,750
I'm your friend.

867
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,416
But I'm not yours.

868
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,958
And Min's never seen you as his friend either.

869
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,166
Oh.

870
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:55,125
Stop caring about him.

871
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,916
Because he's never liked you.

872
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:05,125
What the hell are you talking about?

873
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:26,666
You know why Min disappeared?

874
01:36:27,416 --> 01:36:28,666
He committed suicide.

875
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,791
He did it right where you're standing.

876
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,166
You really like him, right?

877
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:38,458
You know...

878
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,791
in his suicide letter,

879
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,541
he didn�t even mention your name.

880
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,208
Why did you do that?

881
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,708
Because everyone's treated me like trash.

882
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:07,500
And me?

883
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,041
Have I ever treated you like trash?

884
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:04,166
Dad.

885
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,458
Let's go for dinner.

886
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,666
Sounds good.

887
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:11,041
I just sold a large order.

888
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,000
Do you want to eat anything special?

889
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:17,791
I'm tired.

890
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:19,916
Let's go some other day.

891
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:22,125
Let's go today.

892
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,875
I wanna go.

893
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,583
Let's go where we went to the other day. Okay?

894
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:33,583
Dad, you know...

895
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,625
where I went yesterday?

896
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:39,083
I went to Rayong.

897
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,500
Oh.

898
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:44,708
Did he visit you in Rayong?

899
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:12,750
Min.

900
01:40:14,416 --> 01:40:15,375
I'm sorry.

901
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:23,666
Ashamed?

902
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:30,666
You have to get caught before confessing?

903
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:40,583
I thought you were better than this.

904
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,916
Min, talk with me first.

905
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:46,541
Min.

906
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,583
I know that I am selfish.

907
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:56,958
But I've already broken it off.

908
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:03,125
I'm moving back to Bangkok to be with you.

909
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:04,916
Just like I said.

910
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,708
This damn family...

911
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,708
really is repulsive.

912
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:35,125
Min, son.

913
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:36,500
I'm not your son!

914
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:39,000
Your son died a long time ago.

915
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:45,916
You really want to know, right?

916
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:47,708
Why Min killed himself.

917
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:51,541
He freakin' died because of his damn mum!

918
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:24,416
Min.

919
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:26,750
Mum!

920
01:44:17,916 --> 01:44:19,375
The doctor said Mum's in critical condition.

921
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,541
They don't know when she'll wake up.

922
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,041
Dad already told me about Mum.

923
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:36,208
You knew about it all this time, right?

924
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:44,958
I understand now...

925
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,083
why you did what you did.

926
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:52,875
Why didn't you tell me?

927
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:54,166
Why did you keep it to yourself?

928
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,500
Do whatever you want.

929
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:57,791
If you want to study abroad, then go.

930
01:44:58,750 --> 01:44:59,916
I won't be around for long.

931
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,458
Why are you saying such things?

932
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:05,916
You know...

933
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:09,416
Mum and Dad didn't make me stay.

934
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:12,166
It's my decision not to go.

935
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,458
I felt really shitty then.

936
01:45:20,458 --> 01:45:23,208
I gave up everything and you still killed yourself.

937
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:32,500
Stop thinking...

938
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:37,041
that no one loves you.

939
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:47,708
Min's

940
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:52,333
Our Olympics students...

941
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:56,833
will be going to compete in the Academic Olympics.

942
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,375
Please give them a round of applause.

943
01:49:00,791 --> 01:49:01,833
Prima.

944
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,500
Please say something.

945
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:04,333
Here.

946
01:49:04,375 --> 01:49:07,250
Please tell us a little bit about...

947
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,625
how did you prepare?

948
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,416
We've been preparing for years.

949
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:16,750
We started by tutoring since we were in 10th grade.

950
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:24,833
How did Mr Pat help?

951
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:37,166
Prima, are you proud to represent our country?

952
01:50:08,708 --> 01:50:09,416
Pi.

953
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:14,041
I can't go anymore.

954
01:50:17,583 --> 01:50:18,250
Why?

955
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:22,125
I should want to go.

956
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:40,375
Min.

957
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:44,250
Min, will you help me?

958
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,750
Can you kill me?

959
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:53,583
Pi.

960
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:56,833
I'm disgusted with myself.

961
01:50:58,875 --> 01:51:01,375
I can't stand myself anymore!

962
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,250
Do you remember that day on the rooftop?

963
01:51:16,416 --> 01:51:18,166
I was very angry with you.

964
01:51:19,916 --> 01:51:22,041
I was so angry I wanted to jump.

965
01:51:25,916 --> 01:51:27,750
But I don't feel like that.

966
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:31,083
I'm not mad anymore.

967
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:51,250
You don't hate me?

968
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:01,208
I'm right here.

969
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:05,291
And you don't have to be afraid.

970
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:11,250
There's no way I'll let go of you.

971
01:52:34,375 --> 01:52:35,708
You have to go compete.

972
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:39,916
I already made a wish for you.

973
01:53:33,125 --> 01:53:37,125
1 day left

974
01:54:24,208 --> 01:54:29,875
Pi, bring back a medal. Min

975
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,458
What time will rehearsals end?

976
01:55:35,291 --> 01:55:36,791
In the morning.

977
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,416
Li.

978
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,750
I'm sorry for being an ass.

979
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:04,458
Sure.

980
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:11,375
You don't have to apologise.

981
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:17,041
I knew that you've been having problems.

982
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:21,000
I was also an ass.

983
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:25,125
For turning a blind eye.

984
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:27,750
That's not true.

985
01:56:31,166 --> 01:56:32,041
To me...

986
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:34,250
you're the kindest.

987
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:41,625
Don't get sappy.

988
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,166
Beautiful, huh?

989
01:56:57,458 --> 01:56:58,291
Yeah.

990
01:57:07,833 --> 01:57:09,458
It'll be grand tomorrow.

991
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:12,958
You're not coming?

992
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:22,875
The next one's yours.

993
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:26,208
Which one?

994
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,333
I didn't send in one.

995
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:29,833
Well...

996
01:57:30,416 --> 01:57:33,583
I can't stand it if your drawing isn't shown.

997
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,333
So, I took one of your old drawings.

998
01:57:36,625 --> 01:57:37,916
The ones they didn't use.

999
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:40,916
I had to beg them to use it.

1000
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:48,083
From all of your shitty drawings...

1001
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:51,500
I like this one the most.

1002
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:52,458
Ready.

1003
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:53,416
1.

1004
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:55,250
2.

1005
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:56,958
3.

1006
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,916
How come it's the same as mine?

1007
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,666
Did I draw the same one?!

1008
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:33,916
Duh.

1009
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:36,375
When I saw you tear that one up,

1010
01:58:36,791 --> 01:58:38,916
I was confused why you drew the same one.

1011
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:41,416
But I understand.

1012
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:44,916
You've always wanted to show that drawing of her.

1013
01:58:46,083 --> 01:58:47,416
You've never changed.

1014
01:58:49,125 --> 01:58:50,833
You can't quit loving Pi.

1015
02:00:18,166 --> 02:00:19,666
Stop being such a dumbass!

1016
02:01:10,166 --> 02:01:10,916
Min!

1017
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:37,000
Guardian?

1018
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:39,583
Are you ready to go?

1019
02:01:43,083 --> 02:01:44,208
I remember now.

1020
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:49,541
I know who caused Min to kill himself.

1021
02:01:54,875 --> 02:01:56,625
Min killed himself because of me.

1022
02:02:01,833 --> 02:02:03,000
I killed myself.

1023
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,583
I am Min.

1024
02:02:23,125 --> 02:02:24,041
Congratulations.

1025
02:02:24,541 --> 02:02:25,666
You've won.

1026
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:45,875
I...

1027
02:02:47,291 --> 02:02:49,041
I still have to die, right?

1028
02:02:49,958 --> 02:02:50,791
That's right!

1029
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:52,375
You still have to die.

1030
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:00,833
But not today.

1031
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:11,958
Was this all a prank?

1032
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:13,333
What?

1033
02:03:13,875 --> 02:03:14,916
Isn't it good?

1034
02:03:15,458 --> 02:03:17,041
You got to try to be someone else.

1035
02:03:18,083 --> 02:03:20,041
At least you can eat durian now.

1036
02:03:34,333 --> 02:03:35,083
Thank you.

1037
02:03:38,125 --> 02:03:39,666
Thank you for this prize.

1038
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:48,833
Does this mean...

1039
02:03:49,416 --> 02:03:50,875
we won't see each other again?

1040
02:03:52,875 --> 02:03:54,375
We'll meet again.

1041
02:03:55,333 --> 02:03:56,208
Don't forget.

1042
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:58,250
It's only a Homestay.

1043
02:04:01,125 --> 02:04:02,875
I can't give it up either, right?

1044
02:04:03,833 --> 02:04:05,375
Do you?

1045
02:05:33,166 --> 02:05:34,333
Did you fall asleep?

1046
02:05:38,541 --> 02:05:39,208
Li.

1047
02:05:45,083 --> 02:05:46,291
What the hell?

1048
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:51,625
Let's get shaved ice later!

1049
02:05:52,166 --> 02:05:52,916
My treat!

1050
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:21,041
Mum.

1051
02:06:36,375 --> 02:06:37,041
Min.

1052
02:06:42,791 --> 02:06:44,250
I've talked to Dad.

1053
02:06:46,666 --> 02:06:47,750
From now on...

1054
02:06:50,208 --> 02:06:51,416
the four of us...

1055
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:55,416
won't live together as before.

1056
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,791
You can live with Dad if you want.

1057
02:07:08,916 --> 02:07:10,375
Do you regret...

1058
02:07:13,666 --> 02:07:15,083
being my son?

1059
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:25,041
The day you were lying breathless...

1060
02:07:27,666 --> 02:07:29,208
I didn't know what to do.

1061
02:07:33,791 --> 02:07:35,625
I could only think of one thing.

1062
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:42,083
If you really weren't here anymore...

1063
02:07:45,416 --> 02:07:47,833
I wished that you would always be my son.

1064
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:53,333
But I don't want it anymore.

1065
02:07:55,458 --> 02:07:58,125
I wish for you to be born as someone else�s child.

1066
02:08:01,708 --> 02:08:03,333
Someone better than me.

1067
02:08:09,333 --> 02:08:10,416
Someone like me...

1068
02:08:14,208 --> 02:08:16,500
doesn't deserve to be anyone's mum.

1069
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:32,666
I'm sorry, Min.

1070
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:43,208
I don't want to be anyone else�s son.

1071
02:08:49,958 --> 02:08:51,750
No matter what, I'm your son.

1072
02:08:54,791 --> 02:08:56,458
I will always be your son.

1073
02:10:08,291 --> 02:10:10,291
Min : I'm keeping my end of the wish.

1074
02:10:10,333 --> 02:10:11,625
Pi : How?

1075
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:28,041
I'm 18 this year.

1076
02:10:30,041 --> 02:10:30,750
Tick.

1077
02:10:31,041 --> 02:10:31,750
Tick.

1078
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:32,875
Tick.

1079
02:10:33,375 --> 02:10:34,875
The clock starts counting forward.

1080
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,750
If you ask me, am I embarrassed?

1081
02:10:43,875 --> 02:10:45,000
As you can see...

1082
02:10:46,666 --> 02:10:50,500
Just think of it as a Homestay.
