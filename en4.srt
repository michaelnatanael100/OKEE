1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:02,029
Previously on The Fosters...

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,864
So, how long are you
guys gonna be here for?

3
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:08,001
I have no idea. It's not really up to me.

4
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,537
You're not jealous, are you?

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:11,755
Of Callie? No.

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,906
I don't think this is a good idea.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,741
'Cause of Mariana?

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,926
Do you honestly think
that she's gonna care?

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,711
I know she is. She told me.

10
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,897
So that's it? We're just gonna
do whatever mariana wants?

11
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,718
I want everyone to write
about guilt in their journals.

12
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,720
Don't worry. No one's gonna read it.

13
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:28,622
It's just for you to get in
the habit of writing every day.

14
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,792
- She read my journal!
- No, I didn't!

15
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,461
You wrote about Liam?

16
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:36,763
I have to write a story, and
I need a name for the bad guy.

17
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,765
How about Liam?

18
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,701
__

19
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,769
Whoa, leave yourself some
room to breathe, sweetheart.

20
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,938
- Come on, I don't need to breathe.
- Yes, you do.

21
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,607
Do you think the top is too...

22
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,040
- Busty?
- Boring?

23
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,709
Right?

24
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,644
- You should jewel it.
- Ah, si.

25
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,813
- Uh, does that cost more?
- Un poco.

26
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:05,849
- Un poco.
- Por favor, mama?

27
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:08,719
Gosh, ok.

28
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,723
__

29
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,563
Como?

30
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:22,499
She's asking if your
father's tie is going to match

31
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,501
with your dress for the
father-daughter dance.

32
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:26,703
__

33
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:29,740
Ah, que bueno.

34
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:33,777
Uh, so you can dance with a padrino or...

35
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,713
a close friend de la familia.

36
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:40,450
She's dancing with her moms. Right?

37
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,487
Oh.

38
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,555
Hey! Sorry, I'm late!

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,824
Hi, sweetie.

40
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,629
So, oh my goodness, you
look beautiful, sweetheart!

41
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,603
Did you see her face

42
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,571
when Stef walked up in her uniform?

43
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,373
Hilarious.

44
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:04,641
I hate when people say "bueno,"

45
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,743
like you need their approval for something.

46
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,512
When you tell people that
you have a mom and dad,

47
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,547
they don't say, "How wonderful."

48
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,834
Who cares?

49
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,085
I wish I had two moms
throwing me a quinceanera.

50
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,587
My parents refuse and we're Latino.

51
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,490
I mean, so are you, but
you know what I mean.

52
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,559
Yeah, totally.

53
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,594
I just want this to be like, the party that

54
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,265
everybody talks about for
the whole rest of high school.

55
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,566
You know what you need...

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,369
- Three hundred dollars?
- Shh.

57
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,372
For a dress she's only going to wear once?

58
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,607
We'll cut it short and
she can wear it to prom.

59
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,576
We're spending a fortune on this party.

60
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,312
It's not just a party, and we
already set this money aside.

61
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,414
Yes, before we had two more mouths to feed.

62
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,551
Love, I'm just asking can
we just rein it in, please?

63
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:51,254
Did you talk to her about
the Kelsey situation?

64
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,291
- Yes, I did.
- And how did that go?

65
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,227
So, Lexi and I were talking...

66
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,463
can we get a bubble machine for the party?

67
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,264
- No.
- Sure.

68
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,469
- Sure.
- Yes.

69

70
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,180
Make them thinner than that, sweetheart...

71
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,449
I'm just making sure you
have Mariana's playlist...

72
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,319
- Good job, buddy.
- ... nothing too provocative or
with any explicit lyrics.

73
00:03:56,354 --> 00:04:00,290
- What's for dinner?
- Not chips, my friend.

74
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,261
Hey, can Talya stay for dinner?

75
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,430
- Ooh, Lexi, too?
- Sure.

76
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,468
Hey Callie, how was your day?

77
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,404
Uh, it was good.

78
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,509
Uh, so Callie, you know my friend Kelsey?

79
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:23,480
Oh, the one who lied and
said I sold her drugs?

80
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,250
- Yeah, well she's in rehab.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,288
So, do you want to take
her place in my court?

82
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,458
I think that is a great idea, Mariana.

83
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:38,328
Um, what do you think, Callie?

84
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:44,134
- Uh, sure, I guess.
- Great.

85
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,336
We'll just have to hurry and get
your gown fitted before Saturday.

86
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,140
I have to wear a gown?

87
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:53,310
Well, you don't have to do anything.

88
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:56,279
- And we get to do a waltz.
- It's gonna be fun.

89
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:58,381
- Like eating glass.
- Hey, shut it.

90
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,251
So, who does Callie get to dance with?

91
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,186
Brandon.

92
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:08,391
Yeah, I mean, but... you're my date.

93
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:12,028
Well, duh.

94
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:22,205
- Hey, B? Hey.
- Yeah?

95
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:25,408
Everything ok with you and Talya?

96
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:30,013
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
- I don't know, just...

97
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,250
Brandon, listen.

98
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,153
You know that, I'm assuming
that you know that...

99
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:42,025
well, you know, foster
siblings are not allowed to...

100
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:45,061
Hook up? I don't know what
you guys call it these days?

101
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,463
There's nothing going
on between Callie and I.

102
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:49,499
- Callie and me.
- Yeah, ok.

103
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,502
It's just, when the twins
got here you were nine.

104
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,371
- Right, and now I'm a horny teenager.
- Yes.

105
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,206
Hm.

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,009
Mom, I have a girlfriend
and I know the rules.

107
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,044
- Ok.
- Ok.

108
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,089
Will you do me a favor and
take these to your brother?

109
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:10,327
Tell him to please stop leaving
his crap around the house.

110
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:13,029
- Crap is not a bad word.
- It's not a nice word.

111
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,232
Well, give me a word to say then.

112
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:21,004
How's your mom?

113
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,372
- She's fine.
- Yeah?

114
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:25,008
She's taking a shuttle
from the airport tomorrow.

115
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,043
Well, that's good. That'll help us, right?

116
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,012
Yeah, what would help us is
if she wasn't coming at all.

117
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,914
Oh, my gosh.

118
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,950
I'll never understand why
Dana stresses you out so much.

119
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,986
She's nothing but lovely to me.

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,153
You're not her daughter.

121
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,256
Speaking of daughters,

122
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,126
I think ours might be
feeling a little embarrassed.

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,828
About what?

124
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,964
About dancing with us at her party.

125
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,833
Did she say something to you?

126
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,804
- No.
- Well, stop projecting.

127
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,974
Mariana's always been
very proud of us, really.

128
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,176
She's fine.

129
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,784
Should I have Mariachi? That's traditional.

130
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,053
So is having a Catholic mass
and you're not doing that.

131
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,921
Yeah, true.

132
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,759
What about the shoe ceremony?

133
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,127
- Uh-uh. No.
- A doll thing?

134
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,930
My mom's going to be here any minute.

135
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,766
I'm going to go use the ladies' room.

136
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,869
The ladies' room?

137
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,712
Hey, so I know your moms

138
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,981
made you ask me to be in your party.

139
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,984
So, I can tell them I don't want to do it.

140
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,887
I don't know. Whatever.
If you don't want to.

141
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,822
No, it's not that I don't want to.

142
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,557
It's if you don't want me to.

143
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,693
I don't mind.

144
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:53,630
- You know, you don't have to.
- No, I know I don't have to.

145
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:56,833
Ok, well, it's up to you.

146
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:02,505
Ok. Well, then yeah. But
I don't know how to waltz.

147
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, neither do I.

148
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,575
A friend of our moms is teaching us.

149
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,478
Cool.

150
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:11,881
Cool.

151
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,889
- I'm in here.
- Hey!

152
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,758
- You didn't lock the door?
- I'm sorry.

153
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,626
I hate sneaking around like this.

154
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,429
- But, it's kind of hot.
- I mean it.

155
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,398
Fine, let's tell her now.

156
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:29,733
Not before her party.

157
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,539
After.

158
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:38,608
I shouldn't even be doing this.

159
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,477
- Yes, you should.
- I have to go home.

160
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,545
- I have to go home.
- No, you do not.

161
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,815
Go. Go before Mariana thinks I fell in.

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,601
- Hey.
- Hey.

163
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,503
I just wanted to say goodnight to you guys.

164
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:09,672
And Jude, thank you so much for helping
out with dinner, you did a great job.

165
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,341
Thanks.

166
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,478
- Night, Mom.
- Hey you, Jesus Foster.

167
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,350
You're being a real sport
about Mariana's party, eh?

168
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,442
You're a good brother. It's ok.

169
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:25,255
Just as long as I'm the one who
gets the car when we turn 16.

170
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,591
- Yeah, that's gonna happen.
- Yeah, what he said.

171
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,294
All right, goodnight you guys.

172
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:34,164
- Thanks for dinner.
- Yeah, of course.

173
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:42,205
- What?
- Nothing.

174
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,146
- Hey, where's Callie?
- Bathroom.

175
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:53,183
Oh, those look fantastic,
sweetheart. Good job.

176
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,385
All right, goodnight, lovely.

177
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,487
Mm. Don't stay up late, ok?

178
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,290
- Ok, goodnight, Mom.
- Oh...

179
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:03,193
Hey, listen, you know,
Mama said something to me,

180
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,028
and I just wanted to check in with you.

181
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,298
You're not embarrassed to dance
with us at your party, are you?

182
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:42,796
That's a sad lunch, but I
guess it beats prison food.

183
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,065
Really? That's your opening line?

184
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,935
I was going to ask about your rap sheet,

185
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,003
but I thought that was rude.

186
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,874
That's where you're supposed to laugh,

187
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,910
and you realize that we're
both outsiders who nobody gets.

188
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,947
And then you get my name
tattooed on your neck,

189
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,616
until it all goes terribly wrong,

190
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,918
and you have to turn it into a snake

191
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:09,690
just biting your earlobe.

192
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,758
What do you want from me?

193
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,494
What every guy wants.

194
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,664
Stimulating conversation.

195
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,702
And sex. That's probably
off the table, huh?

196
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,806
Look at that smile.

197
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,845
So, listen, some of us are
hanging out at the beach

198
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,481
by the pier, Saturday
night, you should come.

199
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:39,353
- I can't, I have a thing.
- What kind of thing.

200
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,688
The kind that you'd make
fun of if I told you.

201
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,493
When your thing gets boring...

202
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,395
you know where to find me.

203
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,307
Don't be shy. Place your right
hand on your partner's waist.

204
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:05,245
And slightly around to
the small of her back.

205
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,285
Extend the left hand.

206
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,653
Palm raised.

207
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,522
Callie, rest your hand gently in his.

208
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:19,559
Other hand, up on his shoulder like so.

209
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,261
A little closer.

210
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:24,564
Good, hold that position.

211
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:28,468
In partner dancing, connection is key.

212
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:33,140
So, Brandon and Callie,
look into each others eyes.

213
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,376
Breathe.

214
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:40,147
Connect. And you two.

215
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:45,152
And over here. Right hand, on her waist.

216
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,454
Left hand...

217
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:53,493
Everyone? Gram's here!

218
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:58,165
- Dana, you made it.
- Of course I made it.

219
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,134
- Good to see you.
- Oh, hello beautiful.

220
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:03,236
- Hi Mom.
- Oh, your skin looks good.

221
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,726
You've been moisturizing,
but my God, you're pale.

222
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,052
Baby, you need some sun.

223
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:08,962
Yeah, but she's gorgeous. Look at her.

224
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,364
Of course, she's gorgeous.

225
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:14,334
- Gram!
- And there's my beautiful birthday girl.

226
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,038
Oh, and my handsome birthday boy!

227
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,107
Your grandfather's very
sorry he couldn't be here,

228
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,975
but he got stuck in Paris at a conference.

229
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,011
I wish I was stuck in Paris.

230
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,848
You play your cards right
and I will take you one day.

231
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,850
Where's my other dashing grandson?

232
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,985
Uh, practice.

233
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,122
Well...

234
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:39,126
you must be Callie.

235
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,162
- And you must be Jude.
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,198
- It's lovely to meet you both.
- Thanks.

237
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,301
Everyone in this house calls me Gram.

238
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:51,938
Guess what, I've got fabulous presents...

239
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:02,749
Gotta be out the door in 15!

240
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:07,054
- Wow.
- Wow yourself.

241
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:09,122
Mm, we should dress up
for each other more often.

242
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,892
- I know.
- Or you could check your email.

243
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,894
Oh, I'm sorry...

244
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,063
Everything's done, sweetheart. Let it go.

245
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,731
I just want her party to be perfect.

246
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:18,899
She's going to be the center of attention.

247
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,867
For Mariana, it don't
get no better than that.

248
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,104
Ok, you guys need another bathroom.

249
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,707
- You look lovely, Dana.
- You really do, Mom.

250
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,809
Thank you. It's a miracle
because no black woman

251
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:30,811
can tame the mane in 15 minutes.

252
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,679
Luckily, you don't have that problem.

253
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:34,815
Yeah, I don't exactly
just wake up like this.

254
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,051
- Baby, that is a compliment.
- Ok, gift bags. Enough.

255
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,786
It's good... it's good like that.

256
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,856
Well, my you look handsome.

257
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,759
Well, you too... pretty, I mean.

258
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,661
Oh, right, I think.

259
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,029
Help me with the gift bags.
Bring 'em out to the car.

260
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:50,797
Thanks.

261
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,579
- Uh, you need help?
- What?

262
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:10,550
Oh, uh... no. I got it.

263
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:14,488
You look... nice.

264
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,863
Look at you, hottie.

266
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,601
Um...

267
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,872
Well, I should take these to the car.

268
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,413
- You look pretty.
- You, too.

269
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,516
It really is nice for Mariana
to ask you to be in her court.

270
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,552
Seeing as how, you know,
this is a temporary situation.

271
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,557
Well, you never know. I mean,
they might decide to keep us.

272
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:52,459
Maybe.

273
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,628
- I mean, unless...
- What?

274
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,463
- They knew something.
- Something?

275
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,732
Like what happened with Liam.

276
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,702
You make it a habit of reading
other people's journals?

277
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:05,272
Just people I don't trust.

278
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,608
Going to go help Brandon.

279
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,577
What's going on?

280
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:33,450
Hey. You look nice.

281
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:36,419
Oh, thank you. So do you.

282
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,488
That Lena's one lucky lady, huh?

283
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:41,424
- Ok.
- So, listen...

284
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,395
- I wanted to give you this.
- Child support? That's great.

285
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,730
It's for Mariana. It's for the party.

286
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:51,368
Look, I know this is costing you
guys a fortune and I asked around.

287
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,537
It's tradition for friends and
family to help out with these things.

288
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,641
It's very sweet, Mike. I really do
appreciate it, but we can't accept this.

289
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,509
I'm not taking that.

290
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,345
If you don't take it, I'm
going to be deeply offended.

291
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,249
And you, of all people, should know
you don't want me deeply offended.

292
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,418
- Well, thank you very much.
- Ok.

293
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,489
Actually, Mike, there is
something that you could do for me.

294
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,625
Um, I know it's last minute,
but Mariana has actually asked

295
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,628
if you would do the
father-daughter dance with her.

296
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,530
- Really?
- Yeah.

297
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,599
- Seriously, me?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:26,203
Wow. Yeah, of course. I'd be honored.

299
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,538
- Ok.
- I mean, you ok with that?

300
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,141
Yeah, well, apparently
dancing with your two moms

301
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,410
is not exactly quince tradition, so...

302
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:36,246
just roll with the punches.

303
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,415
- What about Lena?
- Oh no, it's fine, really.

304
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:41,518
We want her to have the party she
wants and this is what she wants.

305
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:45,522
Ok, well, she's lucky to have you two.

306
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:48,225
- You're great moms.
- That hurt to say, didn't it.

307
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,428
No, not at all. Hey, look
at you in your penguin suit.

308
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,463
- Huh?
- Never mind.

309
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,132
If I'm going to cut a rug with Mariana,

310
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,968
I'm going to need a little liquid courage.

311
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,970
Ok.

312
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,305
Wait, Mariana is dancing with Mike?

313
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,307
I thought she was dancing with you two.

314
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:07,344
It's fine, Jesus. Will you please
finish up this table for me?

315
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,946
Thanks, love.

316
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,214
Ok.

317
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,189
You look like a princess.

318
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,957
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

319
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,059
What if it's no fun? What if
I trip and fall on my face?

320
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,262
You won't, and it's going to be amazing.

321
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,002
- What is that?
- Your birthday present.

322
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,236
I wanted you to open it first.

323
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,071
Help me open it.

324
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,045
Oh, my God. Did you do this all yourself?

325
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,283
- Where did you get this picture?
- Your moms.

326
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:49,185
- I loved that dress!
- She was new to our school

327
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,822
and she wore this princess
dress every day for like a month.

328
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,024
I was obsessed with Belle.

329
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:56,993
And one day she fell on the
playground and ripped it.

330
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,895
And I burst into tears.

331
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,031
Never mind the fact that
her knee was all bloody.

332
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:04,701
It was humiliating. Everybody
laughed at me, except for Lexi.

333
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,836
She helped me up and took
me to the nurse's office.

334
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,805
You were my first friend.

335
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,740
And best friend.

336
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,777
Thank you. I love you.

337
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,980
I love you.

338
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,819
Can I interrupt?

339
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,758
I'm going to go get everybody together.

340
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,694
I'll see you out there.

341
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,729
Me, too.

342
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,798
Honey, you look beautiful.

343
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,800
Thank you.

344
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,802
So, what's in the box?

345
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,737
Open it and see.

346
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,814
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

347
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,883
Every girl wears a tiara on her quinces.

348
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:56,686
Oh God, it looks so expensive.

349
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,521
It was, don't tell Mom.

350
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,525
Thank you.

351
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,528
Beautiful, beautiful.

352
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,598
- She's my best friend.
- So?

353
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:11,768
So, I'm not thinking about her
feelings, I'm being selfish.

354
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:12,936
What are you talking about right now?

355
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,905
You're not being selfish.
Mariana's the selfish one.

356
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,974
My mom's just spending a bunch
of money on this stupid party,

357
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,776
she's not even dancing with them.

358
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,912
You know what else? She's still
in contact with our birth mom.

359
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,893
After I saved her ass.

360
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,738
We're not ending this.

361
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,553
- Don't do this.
- I'm sorry.

362
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,422
Hi honey, did you find Lexi?

363
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:53,424
- No.
- You ok?

364
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,259
I'm fine.

365
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:58,128
- Hey, have you seen Lexi?
- No.

366
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:01,131
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

367
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,934
You're going to the bathroom a lot lately.

368
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,170
Maybe you have a bladder infection.

369
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:07,371
Mariana?

370
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,108
Here sweetie, on your left wrist.

371
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,309
Ok, everybody, couple up.

372
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,144
The DJ's going to announce the court,

373
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,313
and then Mariana and Jesus,
you'll make your grand entrance.

374
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,382
You all look wonderful,
beautiful, handsome.

375
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,050
Good luck. Come on, Talya.

376
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,985
- Ready?
- All right.

377
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,927
- What are you doing?
- I think we should switch.

378
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:32,296
Sam's too tall for Lexi.

379
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,367
Works for me.

380
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:54,218
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Mariana's quinceanera!

381
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:56,887
Now, can I have everyone please rise

382
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:00,023
and give a warm welcome
as you receive her court.

383
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:02,993
Starting with Lexi Rivera and Sam Wilkins.

384
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:19,009
Let's keep it going with
Callie Jacob and Brandon Foster!

385
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,129
Relax, this is your big moment.

386
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:42,199
And now, the moment we've
all been waiting for,

387
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,101
ladies and gentlemen,

388
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:47,971
Mariana Foster and her
brother Jesus Foster.

389
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,154
But first we'd like to
kick things off with the

390
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:07,057
traditional padrino dance.

391
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,227
Please welcome family friend, Mike Foster.

392
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,179
- Is Mariana ok?
- She's fine.

393
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:32,916
Hey, what was that
about? Did I do something?

394
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,318
You need to tell your girlfriend to chill.

395
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:36,219
Why, what she'd do?

396
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:40,357
She thinks I have a thing for you.

397
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,359
What... she said that?

398
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:45,362
Can you just tell her that
she has nothing to worry about?

399
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:49,266
Please?

400
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:12,289
Very nice.

401
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:14,124
At this time, we'd like to welcome

402
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,926
Mariana's court to the dance floor for

403
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,261
the traditional Viennese Waltz.

404
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:27,004
All right, you're dancing with me. Come on.

405
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:53,196
- I know.
- Know what?

406
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:54,965
About you and Lexi.

407
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,234
Dance.

408
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:01,171
We didn't want to tell you.

409
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:03,874
We didn't want to ruin your party.

410
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:06,276
Well, you did.

411
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:11,214
Ok, forget what I said
about Talya. I'm sorry.

412
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,183
You have nothing to be sorry about.

413
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:17,220
I don't get why it's such a big deal.

414
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:18,989
This doesn't change anything.

415
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,291
You could have any girl you wanted.

416
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:24,261
Why'd it have to be my best friend?

417
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:17,098
Can we have everyone back
to the dance floor, please?

418
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:23,104
What do you say, Dana? You
want to get your groove on?

419
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:25,006
- Why not.
- Come on.

420
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,407
Oh, I don't know who should be more scared!

421
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:29,110
That's right.

422
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:31,212
- Oh no, do we have to?
- Yes.

423
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,125
- You guys are so great.
- Um, I'm thirsty.

424
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,271
- Mariana.
- I have nothing to say to you.

425
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,040
Mariana, wait.

426
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,087
Brandon.

427
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,891
Brandon? What is going on?

428
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:19,193
Don't play dumb with me.

429
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,262
Callie told me what you did.

430
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:23,965
Ok, I read her journal because...

431
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,133
Wait, wait. You read her journal?

432
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,136
- Yes, and I'm glad I did...
- I can't believe you.

433
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,305
No. Shut up! I can't do this anymore!

434
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,307
- I'm done.
- Please...

435
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:35,143
Fine, but ask her.

436
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:38,946
Ask her about Liam.

437
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,087
Mariana.

438
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,992
- Can we talk?
- Talk about what?

439
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,994
How my best friend and brother lied to me?

440
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:56,097
We didn't lie to you,
we just didn't tell you.

441
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:58,232
Same thing.

442
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:01,002
And you know what hurts the most?

443
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:04,272
Hearing all the awful things
that Jesus said about me.

444
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:07,208
And you didn't even defend me.

445
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:10,311
That's not what a best friend does.

446
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,320
Yeah, I'll have another double. Neat.

447
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:21,022
You got it.

448
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,892
Hey, two white wines, please.

449
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:29,096
Hope you're pacing yourself, Mike.

450
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:32,066
It's a party, Stef. Have some fun.

451
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:40,041
This is a lovely party.

452
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:41,275
Thanks.

453
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:44,879
I know money's been
tough for you and Stef...

454
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:47,114
- Mom, we're fine.
- I know you're fine,

455
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:50,251
but with two more mouths to feed,

456
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,286
this is a lot to spend on a birthday party.

457
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:54,889
Well, it's not just a birthday party.

458
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:57,959
This is about Mariana
embracing her cultural heritage.

459
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,294
About being part of the Latino community.

460
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,230
Which, of course, she isn't.

461
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:05,933
I'm just saying being that Latina isn't

462
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:09,003
just about the color of her skin.

463
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:12,306
- But being black is?
- What?

464
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:15,309
For you being black has always been about

465
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:17,011
the color of a person's skin.

466
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,112
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

467
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:20,181
All I've ever said is
that dark skinned people,

468
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:23,284
have a different experience
than light skinned ones.

469
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:26,153
And by different, you mean more authentic.

470
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:28,122
I mean harder.

471
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:31,859
Honey, dark skinned people
face more discrimination.

472
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:35,863
That is just a fact of life.

473
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:40,134
So, maybe we are trying to make up
for what we couldn't give Mariana.

474
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,870
But I understand how she feels.

475
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:44,939
Do you now?

476
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:47,241
You were raised by a black mother.

477
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:48,976
And by a white father.

478
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,414
And I never felt accepted
by either community, Mom.

479
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,283
Well, I'm so sorry if you had such a

480
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,118
tough time being a beautiful
light skinned woman...

481
00:29:57,152 --> 00:30:00,054
- Oh, Mom...
- But like it or not,

482
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:02,423
the color of your skin
has afforded you more

483
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:07,028
opportunities than anyone
like me has ever had.

484
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:08,996
That is what you've always assumed.

485
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:11,032
That being biracial
has made my life easier.

486
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:14,201
Because it has.

487
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:17,271
Like it or not, you will
never know what it is like

488
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:20,274
to be a black woman in America.

489
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,786
Look at the bright side,
now we can dance together.

490
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:38,655
I don't really feel like dancing.

491
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,657
I should go home. Mariana
doesn't want me here.

492
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,760
No, I want you here. It's my birthday, too.

493
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:47,564
- How did she find out?
- I don't know.

494
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:51,434
But look, she's not
letting it ruin her party.

495
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:57,240
We shouldn't let it ruin ours.

496
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:05,582
What's that about?

497
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,584
They have a thing for each other.

498
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,586
How do you know?

499
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,387
I pay attention.

500
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:13,623
They're not going to keep us, you know.

501
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:15,592
What are you talking about?

502
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,393
Brandon.

503
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:19,529
Ok, Jude? I'm not stupid, ok?

504
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:22,699
But sometimes you do stupid things.

505
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,635
Excuse me. Do you want to dance?

506
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,507
Go.

507
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,681
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

508
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:41,351
Is one of those for me?

509
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,453
Is one going to be enough?

510
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,522
There's not enough wine in this world.

511
00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:47,557
This about your mom?

512
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:49,492
She just told me...

513
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:51,594
I don't know what it's
like to be a black woman.

514
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:55,331
She's not right, you know that.

515
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,470
She's right about one thing,

516
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:03,506
and that's why I wanted to
have this party for Mariana,

517
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,408
and why I don't give a
damn how much it costs,

518
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,443
because I understand what that's like.

519
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:09,646
Not knowing where you belong.

520
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,681
I felt like that my entire life.

521
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,650
You know where you belong.

522
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,718
I shouldn't be doing this.

523
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:17,720
- This is Mariana's party.
- Hey, hey, hey...

524
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,489
Listen to me.

525
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,358
This is her party but you
can cry if you want to.

526
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,503
I love you.

527
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,359
Can I have everyone's attention?

528
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,628
Can everyone please find their seat?

529
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:02,232
And can I have Stef and Lena
join us on the dance floor?

530
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:07,403
Mariana, your moms have something
they'd like to say to you.

531
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:18,348
Ok, first of all, Jesus, will
you please come join your sister?

532
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:28,458
Ok, first we want to thank
all of our friends and family

533
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:30,460
for coming to join us and celebrating this

534
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,428
very, very special
birthday today. Thank you.

535
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:39,335
Our babies are 15! Could you believe this?

536
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:44,340
To our beloved Jesus and Mariana,

537
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,745
you have brought so much
joy and love to your moms,

538
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:52,348
and to your brother Brandon's life as well.

539
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:55,418
He begged us and begged us
for a brother or a sister,

540
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,687
and got both in one fell swoop.

541
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:01,424
Um, we love you so very much,

542
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,660
and since a picture is
worth a thousand words,

543
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,187
I'm going to shut up and
we're going to watch this.

544
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,177
So, go over there.

545
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:18,428
Ok, and Jesus, just so you don't
think we forgot about you...

546
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,464
Happy birthday!

547
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:24,167
Not in the house, young man.

548
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:25,334
Thank you so much.

549
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:31,507
Now, may I please have the rest of
the family up here for a photo, please?

550
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,376
Come on.

551
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,478
Come on, Callie and Jude.

552
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,447
Callie, come on.

553
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,185
- All right, Fosters.
- Come on.

554
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,420
Everyone together now.

555
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:47,423
Closer...

556
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,192
All right.

557
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:50,593
Scooch in. Everyone scooch in.

558
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:53,129
- One, two, three.
- Look at that.

559
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:56,232
Smile!

560
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:11,147
Honey, it's a beautiful party.

561
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,258
Yay!

562
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,535
- What happened to Talya?
- She left.

563
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,339
- Are you ok?
- Nope.

564
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:09,138
I broke up with Talya.

565
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:11,140
- Because of me.
- No, no, I...

566
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:14,310
I mean, I'm sure that's what
she thinks, but it's not.

567
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:17,280
I broke up with her because
she's doing stupid things.

568
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:20,249
Like reading your journal.

569
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:26,155
- She told you.
- She didn't tell me what it said.

570
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,157
I didn't want to hear it.

571
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:34,197
Callie, I already know everything
I need to know about you.

572
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:44,106
Hey.

573
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:47,176
Callie? Hey.

574
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:51,247
Callie? Callie, wait.

575
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:55,451
Hey! Brandon?

576
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:59,121
You haven't said boo to
your old man all night.

577
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:02,158
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

578
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:04,393
Come here, come here.

579
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:08,397
I love you.

580
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,199
I love you, too.

581
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:14,503
I love you so much. Look at you, hm?

582
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:18,341
You're a man, now. You're all grown up.

583
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,443
I wish...

584
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:22,411
What?

585
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,248
I wish I could do it all over again.

586
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,286
Dad.

587
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:35,324
Ok, I know it's a party, so go have fun.

588
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,492
I'm going to go home.

589
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:39,362
Ah, I think I should drive you home.

590
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:42,131
I think you're right.

591
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:43,432
I am a police officer,

592
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,268
and I have an example to set for

593
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,103
the fine people I protect and serve.

594
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,471
- I'm this way.
- All right.

595
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:14,363
Mariana? Some of your
guests are starting to leave.

596
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:15,564
What's the matter? Aren't
you having a good time?

597
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,401
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

598
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:21,270
For being selfish.

599
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:24,540
Honey, what are you talking about?

600
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:27,209
This party.

601
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:31,580
It cost so much and
you both worked so hard.

602
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:35,384
I didn't dance with you. I
should've danced with you.

603
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:38,421
I have the best moms in the world

604
00:40:38,455 --> 00:40:40,323
and I should've danced with you.

605
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,558
- Baby.
- Honey, it's ok.

606
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:45,261
No, it's not.

607
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:48,431
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

608
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:51,434
You know what you need?

609
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,402
A mama sandwich!

610
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:56,305
- No!
- Yes! Mommy sandwich!

611
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:02,378
- We love you.
- I love you, too.

612
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:07,316
Lexi, I'm not letting you leave
here without dancing with me.

613
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,324
Did I say it was formal?

614
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,427
I just assumed.

615
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:53,529
You look dumb in that dress.

616
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:56,399
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

617
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,268
Do you want a beer?

618
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,386
