- Drafeir -

2
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,625
Dad, are you driving to Chonburi?

3
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:11,375
Yeah.

4
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,000
Straight there.

5
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,750
Buy me some crab too.

6
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,375
Give me the money.

7
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,708
Stingy.

8
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,125
Fast and wait to eat tomorrow.

9
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,167
When I'm back,

10
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,208
we'll feast.

11
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,875
Thank you, dearly daughter.

12
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:41,292
Sure.

13
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,667
Bye-bye.

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,458
Good morning.

15
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,833
So damn nervous!

16
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:46,958
Will anyone see us?

17
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:47,792
Don't worry.

18
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,083
I've been parking here.

19
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,083
I haven't seen anyone pass by.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,208
Shit!

21
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,417
You scared me!

22
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,500
What the heck?

23
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,500
There might be cameras.

24
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,208
Palm.

25
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:10,833
Palm!

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,167
He's here. Go.

27
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,625
Can't you tail him closer?

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,458
Your dad won't disappear.

29
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,375
Chonburi is straight ahead.

30
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,833
Sit back. You're blocking my view.

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:29,625
Palm.

32
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,458
If I catch him, what should I say?

33
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,875
Don't go telling people off just yet.

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,667
It might be about work for real.

35
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,292
Shameless!

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,917
You know he has a family, but still mess with him.

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,417
Or should…

38
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,833
I tell her off coldly.

39
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:47,708
Slut.

40
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,417
Let's go ask him.

41
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:53,958
Hold it, Palm.

42
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,417
Hold on, I was joking!

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
Dad, Gink has a question for you!

44
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,542
Damn you!

45
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,500
Daddy! / Palm!

46
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,583
Gink's got a question.

47
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,208
Dad!

48
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:03,500
Dad...

49
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,375
Ouch!

50
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,125
Hey...

51
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,708
Are you okay?

52
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,125
I'm fine.

53
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:14,708
Iron dick.

54
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:15,625
Pervert.

55
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,542
Why is he turning left?

56
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,333
Follow him!

57
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:36,583
Man...

58
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,375
Is he flying to Chonburi?

59
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,333
How do we know where he's flying to?

60
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,958
I've checked the flight schedule.

61
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,000
Morning flights…

62
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,333
are only to Chiangmai.

63
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,750
His factory doesn't have a branch there.

64
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,667
He might have some business there.

65
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,167
Let it go.

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,083
Palm.

67
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,625
Lend me some money.

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,125
Here.

69
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,500
I'll pay you later.

70
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,708
Is it too much?

71
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,042
Taking first class?

72
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,167
It includes yours too.

73
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,292
Huh?!

74
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:31,792
Gink!

75
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,167
I'm going in.

76
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,083
Not yet!

77
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:35,833
Calm down.

78
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,875
He's probably talking business.

79
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,250
Who knows who's in there.

80
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,208
Let's go downstairs.

81
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:46,958
Yeah?

82
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,292
Gink.

83
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,875
Gink. Don't climb out.

84
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,292
It's too high.

85
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:28,958
I can't hear a thing.

86
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,375
The wall's too thick.

87
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,708
They say you can hear better at the outlet.

88
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,083
Do you hear anything?

89
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,000
Anything?

90
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,083
It's really thick.

91
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,792
Let's go.

92
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,708
We'll be in trouble if someone comes in.

93
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,167
Let me listen.

94
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,333
I said there's nothing. Why do you insist?

95
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,583
If there's nothing, then move.

96
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,083
Is it really that bad?

97
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,542
Let's go.

98
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,208
Gink.

99
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,000
Where are you going?

100
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:32,750
Ladies and gentlemen…

101
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:36,917
we're descending into Suvarnabhumi Airport.

102
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,375
I think I'll tell my mum.

103
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,208
Umm.

104
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,667
And they'll probably divorce.

105
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,417
When my parents divorced...

106
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,542
I cried for a week.

107
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,583
But believe me.

108
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,417
It'll get better.

109
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,292
It might even be better than being together.

110
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,333
You know…

111
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,417
my dad's really busy with work.

112
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,667
But he still finds time to send me every morning.

113
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,458
Because he doesn't want Mum to get tired.

114
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,500
I've always thought he loves me and Mum so much.

115
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,333
Now, I'm not sure if he really loves us.

116
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,583
I don't know who loves you or not.

117
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,542
But I love you, Gink.

118
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,625
It's okay.

119
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,208
Be with me for now.

120
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:42,708
Palm.

121
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,833
Can I ask you something?

122
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,583
I won't ask again.

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,458
When you said you love me…

124
00:11:58,792 --> 00:11:59,792
what kind of love?

125
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,458
Answer first.

126
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,833
I really love you, Gink.

127
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,875
You're my only friend who I can truly talk to.

128
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,833
Being friends means...

129
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,083
Not worrying about each other.

130
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,625
Not being possessive.

131
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,542
Not fighting.

132
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,875
Not indulging every whim.

133
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,292
The best part is...

134
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,417
friends don't break up.

135
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,542
Fine.

136
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,917
Don't cheer me up with quotes from Facebook.

137
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:14,583
Gink.

138
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,833
Let me gather my thoughts.

139
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,667
Excuse me, please sit down.

140
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,083
Watch out!

141
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,750
I'm sorry.

142
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,250
Good job! Try again.

143
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,250
Good job! Try again.

144
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,125
Hey!

145
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,375
Hey!

146
00:13:58,542 --> 00:13:59,292
Why are you copying me?

147
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,125
Why are you copying me?

148
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,292
Sally sold seashells at the seashore.

149
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,458
Sally sold seashells at the seashore.

150
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,583
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck.

151
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,625
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck.

152
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:17,583
There.

153
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:18,958
Dumbass.

154
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,000
Who can repeat that?

155
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,583
Damn you.

156
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,458
So mean.

157
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,792
You're the mean one.

158
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,708
Stopped talking to me and have Piyachart sit next to me.

159
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,625
His feet stink.

160
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,917
I don't get what he says.

161
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:40,875
Miss your nagging.

162
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:44,625
Fine.

163
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,750
I'll move back tomorrow.

164
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,458
Wait. What are you going to use me for?

165
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,792
I'm seeing Luis.

166
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:00,958
Damn.

167
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,833
What did he do to get you to give in?

168
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:04,542
Secret.

169
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,500
Whatever.

170
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,500
Got a boy, now keeping secrets from your friend.

171
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,833
Whatever.

172
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,083
Being friends is good enough, huh?

173
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,375
All right.

174
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,583
I gotta go.

175
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,375
Yeah. Bye.

176
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,042
Let's go.

177
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,000
New chords.

178
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:34,833
Yeah?

179
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:52,792
Luis!

180
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,792
"Being friends is good enough."

181
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
When I heard this sentence…

182
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,042
I don't know why it burns.

183
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
That was a tell-tale sign…

184
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,125
that I was jealous.

185
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,417
But I was the one who told her to be friends.

186
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,000
Which one?

187
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,292
Over there.

188
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,208
The one singing on stage.

189
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,417
So what?

190
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,542
Overall she's so charming

191
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,625
Don't be shy. It's the truth

192
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,125
She's really charming.

193
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,667
Can you get any cuter? I want to be next to you

194
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
I understand you.

195
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:51,792
Mine is also here.

196
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,125
And she's dancing with her boyfriend right now.

197
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,417
We've been best friends for ages.

198
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:01,958
But…

199
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,292
she's clueless.

200
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,667
Like the movie Dear Dakanda?

201
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,375
Not really!

202
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,000
The main guy…

203
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,083
When Dakanda turns him down…

204
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,292
he mans up…

205
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,292
goes to the beach…

206
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,250
and gets a new girlfriend.

207
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,417
But I don't have the balls!

208
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:28,667
When I was turned down,

209
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:30,542
I didn't even dare to leave.

210
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,500
I understand.

211
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,333
Thank you.

212
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,042
Mine's also the same.

213
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,917
She can't forget her ex.

214
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,333
And said to wait as her friend.

215
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,042
Just like a dog…

216
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,583
who can love only one owner.

217
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,375
It's all right, bro.

218
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,250
I understand.

219
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,208
Thanks a lot.

220
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:58,833
My friend…

221
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,375
is not ready for a relationship.

222
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,167
And wants to graduate first.

223
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,458
Graduated yet?

224
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,000
Just applied for a second masters.

225
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,375
And plans to do a PhD too.

226
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,750
I've found my buddies!

227
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,875
We've fallen hard for them.

228
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:20,583
Yeah!

229
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,958
But they just want to be friends.

230
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:22,542
Damn!

231
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,458
And we give in!

232
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,917
Yay!

233
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:29,708
To the friend zone!

234
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,292
1 year.

235
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,083
3 years.

236
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,125
5 years.

237
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,167
10 years!

238
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:40,958
Wait a sec.

239
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
A decade?

240
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,708
You've been waiting for 10 years?

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,042
It's not really waiting.

242
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:03,833
Pang.

243
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,750
Sorry for what?

245
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,375
Never mind.

246
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,542
Let's just say, I'm sorry.

247
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,375
I'm really sorry.

248
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,083
If you're gonna disappear like this,

249
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,250
then just get lost!

250
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,583
Hold on, Pang.

251
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,542
Ouch!

252
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:20,917
Palm!

253
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,292
Is this how you talk with your classmate?

254
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,417
Just go be with her!

255
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:27,500
Wait!

256
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,833
Let's finally be over and done with.

257
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:38,750
I'm…

258
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,542
I'm gonna tell you something.

259
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,542
Someone like you…

260
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,250
will never find true love.

261
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,875
Damn it!

262
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,875
Doesn't all those years mean anything?

263
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,042
Of course.

264
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:57,833
What then?

265
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,333
Good memories at Savanna Park.

266
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,208
Our picture was here.

267
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,833
And they did it right here!

268
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,917
This isn't my blankie.

269
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,667
Are you really my friend?

270
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,333
I'm not sleeping with you.

271
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,750
How am I supposed to know?

272
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,833
Go sit down.

273
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:33,833
I'll clear it myself.

274
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:46,375
And Gink will get through it

275
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,625
She'll have a change of heart

276
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,333
And Luis will fade away

277
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,792
Even if that table's still there…

278
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,125
even if it hasn't gone anywhere…

279
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:12,833
I'll throw it out for you

280
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,625
Thank you.

281
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:23,875
Gink, you know.

282
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,417
Men are nice to us in the beginning.

283
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,833
Being by our side. Taking care of us.

284
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,542
But in the end, they will be unfaithful.

285
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,333
You can't trust men!

286
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,417
Trust me.

287
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,042
I've seen a lot.

288
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,208
I've been through it all.

289
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,917
Don't bother with love.

290
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:41,667
Parn.

291
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,083
My friend is just your manager.

292
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,417
Does she have to join your spinster club too?

293
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,792
Damn you, Palm.

294
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,625
You're the one who sang…

295
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,208
"Loneliness are opposite poles

296
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,417
Young people should find love", right?

297
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,625
I didn't sing that line.

298
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,250
I was just the chorus then.

299
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,375
Gink, turn the song on.

300
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,083
I'm ready.

301
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,250
I'm feeling it.

302
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,958
I agree with you.

303
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,125
I don't want to be in love again.

304
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,250
Burnt.

305
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:20,917
What?

306
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,167
Are you really done with love?

307
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,792
I was just trying to side with Parn.

308
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,583
Actually, I still believe there is a good guy out there for me.

309
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,708
Sneaky bastard.

310
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:49,792
Hey...

311
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,167
She's flirting like that…

312
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,292
it's time to seal the deal.

313
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,292
She didn't mean me.

314
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:56,750
Sorry!

315
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,083
Ted!

316
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,833
Ted!

317
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:31,833
Cool, huh?

318
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,542
Too cool.

319
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,625
Let me have my moment!

320
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,833
I've moved in with him.

321
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:38,708
Yeah?

322
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,458
Coz you’re his manager,

323
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,333
and it'll make the commute easier, right?

324
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,375
No. I wanna hook-up whenever, okay?

325
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,208
Good. Don't bring too much stuff.

326
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,833
Goong-Gink.

327
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,125
Goong-Gink.

328
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,042
Goong-Gink.

329
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:57,667
Goong-Gink.

330
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,208
No, I'm not going to sing.

331
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,333
I don't know any of your friends here.

332
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,333
Just one duet.

333
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,708
No. Take Palm, then.

334
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,125
Isn't the host his friend?

335
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,250
But this is your fav song.

336
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:06,875
Which one?

337
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,583
Come on.

338
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,417
Just go.

339
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,458
I'll film you.

340
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,042
You just wanna film the singer.

341
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,875
She's my friend. Want her number?

342
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:14,875
Don't give it to him.

343
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,417
He's got too many he can't remember their names.

344
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,208
But I can remember their faces.

345
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,833
My idol.

346
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,000
Ted.

347
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:23,750
Oops. / Take that.

348
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,167
Don't copy him. Okay?

349
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,167
I know.

350
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:27,792
Don't.

351
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,333
Roger that, Goong-Gink.

352
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,458
I won't.

353
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,792
Goong-Gink, just one duet.

354
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,583
My friend's waiting.

355
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,167
No.

356
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,375
Stop it with the Goong-Gink!

357
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:45,583
Palm.

358
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,417
Fill it up.

359
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:48,583
I'll be back.

360
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,250
Just one duet.

361
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,542
I'll fill it to the rim.

362
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,083
Refill again?

363
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,333
It's the 2nd time I've seen you here.

364
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,500
Are these two mugs for you?

365
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,292
Nope.

366
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,208
The other one is my friend's.

367
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,500
Oh…

368
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,542
Same here.

369
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,792
Wonder why they don't do it themselves?

370
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,917
That's a good question.

371
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,667
My friend is dancing with her boyfriend.

372
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,000
You're a good friend.

373
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,667
Maybe too good?

374
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,292
Being nice is painful.

375
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,833
You're really hurt. Look at your face.

376
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,208
I…

377
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:44,708
I…

378
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,583
Don't tell me…

379
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,625
you're also a good friend.

380
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,958
We've got much to talk about.

381
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,042
Excuse me.

382
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:01,625
Excuse me.

383
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,083
Yes?

384
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:04,458
For a friend?

385
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,250
Oh…

386
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,167
They're both mine.

387
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,167
Such a heavy drinker.

388
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,542
I suppose.

389
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,792
I was first.

390
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,417
Sorry.

391
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,250
If you don't love me, then don't be nice to me

392
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:31,208
If you don't love me, then don't care for me

393
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:35,292
If there isn't any love, then don't do anything

394
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,833
Because my heart is weak

395
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,875
If you don't love me, then don't call to check up on me

396
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,083
Because the sound of your voice is painful

397
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,833
Can you please stop?

398
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:56,625
If there isn't any love just let me go

399
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,958
Can you please stop?

400
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:08,375
If there isn't any love just let me go

401
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:09,583
Shit!

402
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,125
Shit!

403
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:12,667
Gink!

404
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,375
Goong-Gink!

405
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,792
Stay still.

406
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:16,583
Don't move yet.

407
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:17,833
Are you hurt?

408
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:19,875
What!

409
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,208
Does it hurt a lot?

410
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm okay.

411
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,292
You'll be dancing again in no time.

412
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,708
Only one person is allowed.

413
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,292
Palm.

414
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,292
Go enjoy your beer.

415
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,583
Don't worry about me.

416
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:56,875
Ted?

417
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,708
I'll keep you posted.

418
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:12,083
I know there's a thin line between friend and boyfriend.

419
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,958
It's very uncomfortable…

420
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,875
having to be in this friend zone.

421
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,208
It's like we're close…

422
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,958
but the reality is…

423
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,292
freakin' far.

424
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,292
I understand you.

425
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,500
They talk with us on the phone for hours.

426
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,500
But talk about other guys.

427
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,333
Yeah.

428
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,500
Say they feel comfortable with us.

429
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:49,708
But when they go on trips…

430
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,208
they go with their boyfriends.

431
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,208
Exactly!

432
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,667
Tell us they love us every day.

433
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,958
Say they miss us every night.

434
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,667
But they never choose us!

435
00:28:58,792 --> 00:28:59,458
Right!

436
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,792
The friend zone's just another kind of jail!

437
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,000
How can you tolerate it for 10 years?

438
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,458
Right. I couldn't!

439
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,125
I've crossed the damn line!

440
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,000
Cross the damn line!

441
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,875
We don’t wanna be just friends.

442
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:14,875
We wanna be hubbies!

443
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:17,583
Wait, hold on.

444
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,167
You've already crossed the line?

445
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:31,333
Love never changes

446
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:32,917
When opportunity knocks…

447
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,958
you have to take the risk.

448
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:06,875
Are you making it up?

449
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,583
It's up to you if you don't.

450
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,042
What did you wish for? I heard my name.

451
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,250
What did you wish for?

452
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:25,833
Just a sec.

453
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,458
Hello, clutz.

454
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,750
Have you taken off your cast?

455
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:33,708
Dude...

456
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,750
I've been puking.

457
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,167
And my period hasn't come.

458
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,958
I might be pregnant.

459
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,500
What?!

460
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,125
Where are you?

461
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,167
I'm in Malaysia.

462
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,833
Huh?!

463
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,208
Oops, sorry.

464
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:50,833
What are you doing there?

465
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,292
Where are you?

466
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,125
Myanmar.

467
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,292
Where's Ted?

468
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,250
I came alone.

469
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,042
Can you come see me?

470
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,458
I'm not just down the road.

471
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,708
I don't know what to do next.

472
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,333
Calm down.

473
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,125
I'll call you back.

474
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,042
Palm, now can you tell me?

475
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:11,917
What did you wish for?

476
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:12,875
I wish to leave.

477
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,250
Thank you, sir.

478
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,333
It's raining. / It's okay.

479
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,458
Malay' Malay'

480
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:31,833
Malay' Malay'

481
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,833
Malay' Malay'

482
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,125
I want to see you

483
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,583
Malay' Malay'

484
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,208
Malay' Malay'

485
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,875
Malay' Malay'

486
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,125
Bought a flight

487
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,292
to Kuala Lumpur

488
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:52,542
Gink.

489
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,833
You really came!

490
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,875
Just a food baby, you're not preggo.

491
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,750
What damn food baby?

492
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,917
I can't eat anything.

493
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,292
I bought a pregnancy test.

494
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,500
But I'm scared to test.

495
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:18,917
I've been waiting for you.

496
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,042
Where is it?

497
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:28,625
Where did it go?

498
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,458
Gink.

499
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,667
Get it together.

500
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:32,833
It's in your hand.

501
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,042
I'm...

502
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,792
gonna do it now.

503
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:39,750
Sure.

504
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,000
Have you told Ted yet?

505
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,917
I've only told you.

506
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:09,500
I can't pee.

507
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:12,750
Try to squeeze it out.

508
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,000
Man, it won't come out.

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,708
I'll help you.

510
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,500
Why are you holding it in?

511
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,167
I'm not. I'm squeezing!

512
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,458
What does it mean?

513
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,708
Not pregnant!

514
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,000
Told ya, food baby.

515
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,583
Why did you puke?

516
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,250
I must…

517
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,250
be stressed out.

518
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,875
Did you fight with Ted?

519
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:18,500
Well…

520
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:23,042
we're working on a jingle for King Power.

521
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:24,958
It's Palmy's song.

522
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,625
It has to be sung in different languages.

523
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,792
We've got to record singers from different countries.

524
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,333
I hurt my leg, so I couldn't go with him.

525
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,542
He had to fly alone to Laos.

526
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,667
Can you please tell me?

527
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,250
Is this real or am I overthinking?

528
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,292
I'm starting to get anxious

529
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,458
With an unanswered question

530
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:53,583
Tell me what's in your heart

531
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:57,958
I wanna know what you're thinking

532
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,125
Or are you planning to lead me on

533
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,542
Do you want to see my tears?

534
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:05,958
And he went to Vietnam.

535
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,792
I want to tell you

536
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:12,500
How anxious I am

537
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,708
Before you say anything

538
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,583
I want you to promise me

539
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,250
That you won't let me down

540
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,583
Then the Philippines.

541
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,167
Is our love still as good as before?

542
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:26,958
Are we still together in our dreams?

543
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,542
Your heart hasn't changed

544
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,625
And our love is still the same

545
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,708
On to Malaysia.

546
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,250
All I want is for you to say it

547
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,083
Tell me that you think it

548
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,625
Tell me. So I am sure

549
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:49,208
That our love is still the same

550
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,250
Am I right?

551
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,083
The singers…

552
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,542
are all young and pretty too.

553
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,292
Ted is such a good guy.

554
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,208
And I trust him.

555
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,792
I'm not being a baby.

556
00:35:58,542 --> 00:35:59,375
Stop bragging.

557
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,000
Get to the point.

558
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,375
Get up. Come closer.

559
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,542
When he's done in Malaysia,

560
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,917
he flew to Indonesia.

561
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,375
I met up with him there.

562
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,125
Why did you go this time?

563
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,417
Well, I missed him.

564
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,458
Stop interrupting.

565
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,833
When I went to Indonesia, guess what happened.

566
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,000
These headphones aren't good.

567
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:24,500
Gink.

568
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,333
Could you please get my new ones?

569
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,333
They're in my bag.

570
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,958
He bought new ones again?

571
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:31,958
How many ears does he have?

572
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:34,583
It's in the navy-blue box.

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,583
This one?

574
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,292
Yeah.

575
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
What for?

576
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,458
For love.

577
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:55,667
I was totally surprised.

578
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,875
He bought us the same watches.

579
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,750
Even though it's not my birthday,

580
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,708
anniversary or any other important day.

581
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,000
I can't stop thinking, it's like…

582
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,875
he's guilty of something, and he's covering up.

583
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,500
So...

584
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:14,125
I checked on a lil' somethin'.

585
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,792
Before saying anything else

586
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,583
I want you to promise me

587
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,792
That you won't let me down

588
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,375
How about you two sing in  harmony together?

589
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,208
You should go inside to talk to them.

590
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:31,833
So, it's clearer.

591
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:35,750
Yeah.

592
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,208
Good idea.

593
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,667
So smart.

594
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,917
I peeked at his chat.

595
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,750
But there wasn't anything strange.

596
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,833
I went through his wallet.

597
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,292
You know, what I found?

598
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,250
A restaurant receipt from Malaysia.

599
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,000
I thought you found a bra.

600
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,833
You flew here because of a receipt?

601
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:15,833
Are you a millionaire?

602
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,458
My money, my business.

603
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,875
Read what he ordered!

604
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:24,292
Hamburger.

605
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:24,958
Beer.

606
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:25,833
So?

607
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,167
Those were what he ate.

608
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,292
Keep reading.

609
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:31,750
Cesar salad.

610
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,625
Chocolate lava.

611
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,667
Strawberry chamomile.

612
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,375
Cesar salad.

613
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:39,583
Chocolate lava.

614
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,667
Strawberry chamomile.

615
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,958
Enjoy.

616
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,792
Who do you think Ted came with?

617
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,875
I think the singer.

618
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,292
She's cuter than me too.

619
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,375
Check this out.

620
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,792
Let me see. Who's cuter than you?

621
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:00,875
You're right.

622
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,375
Excuse me.

623
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:08,792
Have you ever seen Joyce Chu coming here?

624
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,583
We're her fans from Thailand.

625
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,750
She comes here quite often.

626
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,708
So...

627
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,042
She also came here last week, right?

628
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,750
One minute.

629
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,458
Hey!

630
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:31,167
Did Joyce Chu come here last week?

631
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,958
No, I haven't seen her for a while.

632
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,542
Sure or not?

633
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,625
But she always comes.

634
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,917
Last week you didn't come.

635
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,458
Hey, I'm asking about Joyce Chu.

636
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,500
Not her.

637
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,333
Joyce Chu didn't come.

638
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,292
I did come.

639
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:41,833
She didn't come.

640
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:42,917
Last week she came.

641
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:43,583
She came.

642
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,750
She came, right?

643
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,083
She didn't come.

644
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,458
She didn't come.

645
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,000
Now, I'm confused who came or not.

646
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,208
It's okay.

647
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,042
I was just asking.

648
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,125
Thank you so much.

649
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,208
Sorry.

650
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,542
I think she came, but they can't remember.

651
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,750
They might have come for dinner and parted after.

652
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,708
Just trust him.

653
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,042
Then why does Ted have to feel guilty?

654
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:10,750
Dude...

655
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,667
these dim lights.

656
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,292
These ballads.

657
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,167
With a girl staring into his eyes.

658
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,833
Wouldn't sparks start to fly?

659
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,208
I don't know.

660
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:30,833
I'm not Ted.

661
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,667
Sorry. Let me get this.

662
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,667
Hello, Goong-Gink?

663
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,417
I'm going back now.

664
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,292
Don't go to sleep just yet.

665
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:10,042
I'll be home and talk with my honey Goong-Gink all night.

666
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,000
Wait for me.

667
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:14,583
Okay.

668
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,083
I'm sorry, Joyce.

669
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,875
My girlfriend is waiting for me. I've gotta go.

670
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,042
Really?

671
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,542
But I'm still having a good time.

672
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,708
Can't you stay a bit longer?

673
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,042
No. No. No.

674
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,375
Please?

675
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,500
Pretty please?

676
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,542
Let's not.

677
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,333
I already have a girlfriend.

678
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,250
Although she's got a flat rack, they're natural.

679
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,042
I like them.

680
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,000
Ted.

681
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,750
Is your beard too thin?

682
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,333
Let me fill it in.

683
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,792
Hey, don't play with food.

684
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,208
How come you can?

685
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:55,958
Palm.

686
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:57,875
It's messy.

687
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,292
It's the last step.

688
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,583
Very good.

689
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:17,750
Do you wanna piggyback?

690
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,333
No. I'll break your back.

691
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,250
Leave me here.

692
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,125
What's your plan?

693
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,125
Actually, I told Ted that…

694
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,750
I've got a check-up in Bangkok.

695
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,292
I'll meet up with him later.

696
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,375
Where are you flying to?

697
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,583
Ted's in Cambodia.

698
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:45,333
Don't get ballsy.

699
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,167
Look at yourself.

700
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,667
Okay.

701
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:52,958
Here.

702
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,292
Thanks so much.

703
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,417
I don't know where I'd get another best friend like you.

704
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,250
Glad you know it.

705
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,250
Bye. / See you.

706
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,125
Can you grab a taxi for me, please?

707
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,542
Thank you.

708
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:41,750
Gink.

709
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,167
What are you doing?

710
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,542
I'm afraid it'll be a long wait.

711
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,750
I'm keeping you company.

712
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,167
Hey! Hold on.

713
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:00,875
Don't go just yet.

714
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,500
Stay.

715
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,542
You're really a character.

716
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:08,042
Oh.

717
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,875
This was pointless.

718
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:28,958
Ahem!

719
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,167
So...

720
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,917
let me know you're safe.

721
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,125
Thank you.

722
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,208
No thank you.

723
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,667
Are we still together in our dreams?

724
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:26,292
Your heart hasn't changed

725
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:30,208
And our love is still the same

726
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:32,750
Am I right?

727
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,500
I don't know I think something was off.

728
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,958
Is that correct or?

729
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,417
I think you have such beautiful voice.

730
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,750
Oh, thank you very much. That's very nice of you.

731
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:43,500
Okay.

732
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,083
But how about stick with the original melody.

733
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,417
And that would be perfect.

734
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:49,958
Gink.

735
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,667
Is the backing track ready?

736
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,250
One moment.

737
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,917
You wanna try one more time?

738
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:02,333
Tell me. So I am sure

739
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:06,583
That our love is still the same

740
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,667
Am I right?

741
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:09,667
It's beautiful!

742
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,042
OMG!

743
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,292
It's gone.

744
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,667
So...

745
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,500
Can we still record?

746
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,583
I don't think we can.

747
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:29,917
The backing track is in there.

748
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,667
Sorry, Laura.

749
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,125
When will you be available again?

750
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,583
Umm...

751
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:44,333
Goong-Gink.

752
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:45,333
Goong-Gink.

753
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,542
You don't have to cancel.

754
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,333
Give me 15 minutes.

755
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:08,208
I want to tell you

756
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:12,333
How anxious I am

757
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,250
Before you say anything

758
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,250
I want you to promise me

759
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,375
That you won't let me down

760
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:23,042
Is our love still as good as before?

761
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,917
Are we still together in our dreams?

762
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:30,583
Your heart hasn't changed

763
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,833
You can yell at me.

764
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,583
My heart can't.

765
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,667
Do you have any extra PJs?

766
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:02,917
I forgot mine.

767
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,083
3 condoms

768
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,542
Thank you. Have a good one.

769
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,958
Choose the next trip for us.

770
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,250
Umm...

771
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,542
Can it wait?

772
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,750
I don't want to go anywhere for a while.

773
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:14,958
Okay.

774
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,542
Aui.

775
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:21,167
I'm sorry.

776
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,000
I've been flying a lot.

777
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,208
I want to rest at home.

778
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,625
You really like staying at home, huh?

779
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,667
When we're in Myanmar, you left early.

780
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,917
You used to fly 6 landings and still go out afterwards.

781
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,000
Fine.

782
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,583
Let's go.

783
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:39,458
When do you take leave?

784
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,167
If you don't want to go, then don't.

785
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:45,917
Do you want me to drop you off?

786
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:48,083
Let me know the next time you want to join.

787
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,833
Excuse me.

788
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,250
Sorry. Excuse me.

789
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,625
Excuse me.

790
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,667
Sorry.

791
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,875
Excuse me.

792
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:05,792
Excuse me.

793
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,333
Excuse me.

794
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:13,958
Yes?

795
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,958
Where are you?

796
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:15,917
I'm home.

797
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:16,667
What's up?

798
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,250
Look down here.

799
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm in front of your house!

800
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,792
Think about it.

801
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,167
Ted's alone in Cambodia,

802
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,542
why would he buy condoms?

803
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:34,125
Just in case.

804
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,542
But he used one!

805
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,292
Have you asked him yet?

806
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,625
He'll come up with excuses.

807
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,500
I think it's probably one of those singers.

808
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,750
I'm gonna go see for myself.

809
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:47,625
What?

810
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:49,583
Gink.

811
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,417
Have you lost your mind?

812
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,458
Are you trying to be Detective Conan?

813
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,875
There's only one truth.

814
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,917
Leave me here.

815
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:07,417
Bye.

816
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:09,375
Don't worry about me.

817
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,708
May I assist you?

818
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,500
Thank you so much.

819
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,833
Without you, I'd be so helpless.

820
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,125
My pleasure.

821
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,333
You're so macho.

822
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:52,167
Excuse me.

823
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,042
You know…

824
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,792
whenever I fly, I always think of you.

825
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,292
I've wanted to see you at work.

826
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:08,458
Palm.

827
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,750
You fly on your employee perks, right?

828
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,500
Right.

829
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,083
Are there friend perks?

830
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:15,333
Oh.

831
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,500
There's only mum tickets.

832
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,625
Maternal mum?

833
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,917
Mum of my child.

834
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,583
Interested?

835
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,417
It's good to be you.

836
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:26,500
There's nothing to stress out about.

837
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,250
Says who?

838
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,875
You didn't repay me for the Chiangmai tickets,

839
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:31,875
I was stressed.

840
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,708
I couldn't go out on any dates.

841
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,500
Why didn't you ask me for it?

842
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,708
You wouldn't even talk to me.

843
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,333
My date had to treat me.

844
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,833
So damn embarrassing.

845
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:45,792
Gimme your hand.

846
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,917
The other one.

847
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,625
Hong Kong's faster by an hour.

848
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:11,333
Who asked?

849
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,417
Palm.

850
00:53:42,417 --> 00:53:43,500
The manager is outside.

851
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,333
They're almost finished.

852
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:54,083
Shit!

853
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,917
Ted's video calling in!

854
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,542
What should I do?

855
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:58,792
Don't answer it.

856
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:02,958
I can't.

857
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,542
I want to see who's he with.

858
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:06,375
Hello.

859
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,000
Hello, Goong-Gink.

860
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,375
Where are you?

861
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:11,417
Oh.

862
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:13,250
Hold on, Ted.

863
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,250
Damn.

864
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,000
Where?

865
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:19,958
Where they sell...

866
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,083
dumplings and steamed buns.

867
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:22,792
Gold shops.

868
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:25,917
I'm at Chinatown.

869
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:30,458
Just got my cast off and stopped by to eat.

870
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,417
Oh.

871
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,000
Dumplings and steamed buns.

872
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,958
Dim sum.

873
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:41,875
Hargow and beef balls.

874
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,333
Do you want anything else?

875
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,292
Do you have fried taro?

876
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:50,875
This is steamed dish cart, not fried dish.

877
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,042
The fried dish cart just passed, why didn't you order?

878
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:54,208
Gyoza?

879
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,250
It's the best.

880
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,500
Bring whatever you have.

881
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,125
Shithead.

882
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:58,958
Oh!

883
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,042
Oops!

884
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,292
That hungry? Don't bite him, okay?

885
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,750
Sorry, Ted.

886
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,625
I'm starving.

887
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,417
So...

888
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:09,125
how's the recording session? Are you done?

889
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,083
I'm done.

890
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:12,333
The singer is fabulous.

891
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,667
Are you still with her?

892
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,458
Do you wanna talk to her?

893
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:19,042
Jia.

894
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,583
This is Gink.

895
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,333
She's my manager also my girlfriend.

896
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,083
Oh, wow. Hello.

897
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:26,833
Hi!

898
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:28,833
You...

899
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,625
You look so pretty.

900
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:31,917
You're prettier.

901
00:55:31,917 --> 00:55:33,667
She's the one who manages everything

902
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,292
and makes this project happen.

903
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,542
Wow, cool.

904
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,750
Thank you so much for helping out.

905
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,667
Are you tired?

906
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,417
Oh, no.

907
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,958
Working with Teddy is very good and very fun.

908
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:45,667
Anyway.

909
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,667
Bye-bye.

910
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,500
Bye-bye.

911
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,875
Thank you so much, mate.

912
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,542
You're welcome.

913
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:53,083
See you later.

914
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:53,958
See you.

915
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:56,458
Are you going home after dinner?

916
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:57,875
Yes.

917
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,167
How about you?

918
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:00,417
Are you going anywhere else?

919
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:03,167
I'm going straight to the hotel and sleep.

920
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:04,417
So exhausted.

921
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:06,875
Okay. I won't bother you.

922
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,333
Enjoy your dinner.

923
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:08,958
See ya.

924
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:09,625
Bye-bye.

925
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,958
Bye-bye. Miss you.

926
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:39,958
Satisfied?

927
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,250
Gink.

928
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,417
That singer's here.

929
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:56,792
Who is he talking to?

930
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,500
Gink.

931
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,292
She's looking at us.

932
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:10,875
Palm.

933
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:15,125
Gink.

934
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:19,375
There's a girl in the car.

935
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:30,667
Wait for me!

936
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,000
Gink.

937
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:34,917
Calm down.

938
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,042
Do you know where to find him?

939
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,667
I'll wait for him at the hotel.

940
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,083
Intercon.

941
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,292
Go. Go. Go.

942
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,875
People have generic faces, huh?

943
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:08,167
She said that Ted isn't back yet.

944
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:09,250
Okay.

945
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,708
Your drinks.

946
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:12,542
Thank you.

947
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,917
Why did you order so many?

948
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,417
This is yours. This is mine.

949
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:24,250
The rest are for throwing at him if he brings her here.

950
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,792
Here's your scissors.

951
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:28,375
Damn! Are you gonna stab him?

952
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,417
It's for cutting off my cast.

953
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:31,958
I told Ted I took it off. It won't look real.

954
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:34,417
But you told him you're in Chinatown.

955
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,042
Well, I wanted to surprise him.

956
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,167
Hurry up and cut it.

957
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:49,208
What?

958
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:51,750
You've lost it.

959
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,375
Do you realise it?

960
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:55,917
Why are you so obsessed with him?

961
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:01,167
You know I don't want to get married.

962
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,208
Yeah, I know.

963
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:05,583
But I want to marry him ASAP.

964
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,500
You know…

965
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:10,250
every song I listen to makes me think of him.

966
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,500
I was never like this with Luis.

967
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:14,583
Infatuated.

968
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,250
Palm.

969
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:17,708
I'm obsessed!

970
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,917
When I heard him talk about our future,

971
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,583
I just wanted to warp to that part.

972
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,875
He said he wants to have 3 kids.

973
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,292
So, he can form a band.

974
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,083
The first born will learn the piano.

975
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:31,875
The second, the violin.

976
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:32,958
Daydreaming.

977
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,458
It's what everyone says before marriage.

978
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,417
But who knows if it'll turn out like that.

979
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,375
Actually, marriage is a good thing.

980
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:41,583
Mum told me,

981
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:45,417
if he strays, I can sue both him and the mistress.

982
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,667
You make it like money will get rid of your sorrow.

983
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:51,542
You just go on being the player you are.

984
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,083
Who said I don't want to get married?

985
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,042
In your case,

986
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,667
marriage will bankrupt you!

987
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,667
Yeah.

988
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,542
Stop being nosy if you want to get married.

989
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:08,208
You'll divorce.

990
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,458
What do you mean?

991
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,167
I'm not supposed to know what he's done?

992
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:12,917
I'm sick of this.

993
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:14,833
You didn't do anything wrong. What are you sick of?

994
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,958
Your foot!

995
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:17,333
Damn stinky.

996
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:19,417
That's enough.

997
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:20,583
Don't you start with me.

998
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,792
We're not getting married.

999
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:25,042
Go on waiting for your groom.

1000
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,875
Where is Ted?

1001
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,542
Why isn't he answering?

1002
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,500
He said he's coming back to the hotel.

1003
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,708
Has it been too long?

1004
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,542
Should I report it to the police?

1005
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,792
Gone with a girl 2-3 hours.

1006
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,375
The police won't take the report.

1007
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,708
Go hide.

1008
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,958
Palm, I don’t dare look.

1009
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:27,750
They're getting out.

1010
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,208
Ted, right?

1011
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,083
I think he must have been in some kind of accident.

1012
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,375
Should I call the police?

1013
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:47,375
At least we'll know what happened.

1014
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,167
You should try calling with a different number.

1015
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,208
Hello.

1016
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,292
Hello?

1017
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,250
Can you hear me?

1018
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:23,500
Hello?

1019
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,333
Let's go.

1020
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,583
Maybe…

1021
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,167
the woman in the taxi is Ted's friend.

1022
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,125
They might have dinner plans.

1023
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,458
Then go their separate ways.

1024
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:21,875
Ted might…

1025
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:25,625
be drunk and couldn't get to the hotel.

1026
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:26,542
So, he…

1027
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,708
went to a hostel near there to crash.

1028
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,375
That's why he didn't answer your calls.

1029
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:36,375
And...

1030
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:38,542
Ted…

1031
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:39,917
well…

1032
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,750
had to take a piss.

1033
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,875
So, he got up to take a piss,

1034
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:47,625
which was the same time you used my number to call.

1035
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,125
What am I doing here?

1036
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:51,375
Huh?

1037
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:55,208
What am I doing here?!

1038
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:55,917
Shit!

1039
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,667
What am I doing here?!

1040
01:03:59,042 --> 01:03:59,625
Gink!

1041
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,083
What am I doing here?!

1042
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,333
You're being noisy!

1043
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,667
Stop!

1044
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:09,667
Stop! Stop!

1045
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:10,750
My friend's in danger.

1046
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,167
She jumped on the sign.

1047
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,042
Look outside.

1048
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:13,792
Look outside!

1049
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,042
Whoa!

1050
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:27,542
Go back.

1051
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:28,458
Back your car.

1052
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,083
Go back.

1053
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:29,708
Move backward.

1054
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,917
Move backward.

1055
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:32,625
Please back up.

1056
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:33,708
Go back. Go back.

1057
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,375
Very good.

1058
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:39,875
Gink!

1059
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:41,750
Gink.

1060
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,417
Hold on.

1061
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:45,625
Hold on tight.

1062
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,458
Gink.

1063
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:47,250
I'm coming.

1064
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:50,500
Gink!

1065
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:52,875
I'm here to help.

1066
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,000
I shouldn't have come!

1067
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,250
I shouldn't have found out!

1068
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:01,292
Look at me, Gink.

1069
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:04,750
I'm right here.

1070
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,500
I'm here for you.

1071
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:28,667
Good girl.

1072
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,250
You're my good girl.

1073
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,292
Tell your wife she's not Jackie Chan, okay?

1074
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:00,708
Sorry for every trouble causing by my friend.

1075
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:02,875
So...

1076
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,250
she's not your wife?

1077
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:06,208
No. No. No.

1078
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,208
We're just friends.

1079
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,042
Friend zone!

1080
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,042
I'm not your friend, fatso!

1081
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:19,583
Goodbye.

1082
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:29,625
Gink.

1083
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:33,708
Don't you ever do that again.

1084
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:37,375
If you fall, you could die.

1085
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:47,500
C'mon.

1086
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,292
Let's go home.

1087
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:51,583
I don't want to go home yet.

1088
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:55,583
Are you working tomorrow?

1089
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:58,125
Of course.

1090
01:06:58,583 --> 01:06:59,833
I fly in the morning.

1091
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:00,708
I can't take leave either.

1092
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,750
I don't want to be alone.

1093
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,542
For your safety, please fasten your seat belt while seated

1094
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:27,708
until the airplane's come to a complete stop and the seat belt sign is off.

1095
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,708
When opening the overhead bins,

1096
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:33,083
please be careful of any items that may fall on you or other passengers.

1097
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,375
You can pick up your baggage at belt 1.

1098
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,708
Thank you.

1099
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:53,833
Thank you.

1100
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,167
Hope to see you again.

1101
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,000
Thank you.

1102
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,500
Thank you. Have a fun trip.

1103
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,583
Can't you go with me now?

1104
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,458
I have another flight and I'll rush back to see you.

1105
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,417
Thanks a lot.

1106
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:15,500
Thank you.

1107
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,125
Palm, why didn't you tell us your friend was flying?

1108
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,125
Oh.

1109
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,875
This is Gink.

1110
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,167
Is this your first time to Krabi?

1111
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:27,583
Oh, we're just friends.

1112
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:34,875
Gink!

1113
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,042
Don't forget to eat.

1114
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,500
Excuse me.

1115
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,750
Just like the ad.

1116
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:05,375
Gink, I'm here.

1117
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,917
Damn!

1118
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:16,167
Have you been here all this time?

1119
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,167
Palm.

1120
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,042
Go buy me more beer and freeze it.

1121
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:23,500
I want some beer slushie.

1122
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:27,708
That's enough.

1123
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:52,292
What the hell are you eating?

1124
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,417
Fusion food.

1125
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:11,875
C'mon.

1126
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:12,708
Let's go out.

1127
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,583
No.

1128
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,833
I'm gonna sleep right here.

1129
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,083
I'm gonna eat, sleep and repeat.

1130
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,167
Go get some fresh air.

1131
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:20,375
It'll help.

1132
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,750
Believe me.

1133
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,083
I'm always breaking up with girls.

1134
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,500
Take a look at me.

1135
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:28,667
This is how all the girls you've dumped look like.

1136
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,167
I'm a mortician.

1137
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:41,125
You're such a burden.

1138
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:44,500
I’m here to avenge you for your ex's.

1139
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,417
Bring it on.

1140
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:50,250
I've never worried over anyone else as much as you.

1141
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,125
Enough.

1142
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,750
I'm pretty enough.

1143
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,375
Where are you taking me to?

1144
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:41,125
You know how to speak Chinese?

1145
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:42,917
What did you wish for?

1146
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:43,917
I heard my name.

1147
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,792
For us to stay together forever.

1148
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:47,375
C'mon.

1149
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:49,167
You only know one sentence.

1150
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,583
It's your cheesy pick-up line, right?

1151
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,042
How about you?

1152
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:54,833
Don't you know?

1153
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,042
If you tell others, it won't come true.

1154
01:12:57,417 --> 01:12:58,417
How is it?

1155
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,750
Together forever? Has it come true for anyone?

1156
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,625
Why did you peek at me?

1157
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:04,500
Did you curse me?

1158
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:07,542
I was wishing for you to stop being a player.

1159
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,083
See, I told you.

1160
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:10,000
It won't come true.

1161
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:15,250
Why do you want me to stop?

1162
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:22,208
I feel sorry for the girls who are your victims.

1163
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:23,833
Let's go.

1164
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:30,917
Have you wondered…

1165
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:32,375
what if we were an item?

1166
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:36,625
It'd probably be like today.

1167
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:40,625
What?

1168
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:44,500
Well, what do you think?

1169
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,667
I'd probably go crazy.

1170
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,250
I'd probably check your phone all day.

1171
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:49,708
Other girls probably text you all day.

1172
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,333
Who'd dare cheat?

1173
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,667
You hangin' off that sign is stuck in my head.

1174
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,458
How can a player stop playing?

1175
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,625
How many girls are you talking to?

1176
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:03,833
What, how many?

1177
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,167
I'm talking to no one right now.

1178
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:06,458
Let me see.

1179
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:08,500
Palm reading?

1180
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,250
Passcode?

1181
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:27,250
Are you my girl checking my phone?

1182
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,500
Don't!

1183
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:33,875
Kidding.

1184
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,250
Stop for a sec.

1185
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:08,000
What?

1186
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,125
Stop the bike first.

1187
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,208
Ted's calling.

1188
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,000
Palm!

1189
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,667
Look ahead!

1190
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:21,708
Damn it. Sorry.

1191
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:22,542
Are you hurt?

1192
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,625
Gink!

1193
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:29,667
Gink!

1194
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:32,083
Gink, hop on.

1195
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,333
Hold on tight.

1196
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,083
Palm!

1197
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,000
Monkey!

1198
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,167
Monkey!

1199
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,542
Ouch!

1200
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,167
You thought I was the monkey?!

1201
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,708
There are similarities.

1202
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,000
I nearly pissed!

1203
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,375
Take me to the toilet right now!

1204
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,625
Can't you hold it?

1205
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,708
We're almost in the city.

1206
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,458
I can't!

1207
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,708
Go away! Dumbass monkey!

1208
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:27,542
One day Gink took a piss in the woods

1209
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,708
Gink met a lil' monkey

1210
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,167
Palm. / What?

1211
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:35,833
Crap.

1212
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:38,500
Gosh…

1213
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:39,792
What's wrong with your butthole?

1214
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:41,083
Do you have any tissue?

1215
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,458
Nasty.

1216
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,083
I'll use my panties to wipe.

1217
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,083
What the hell!

1218
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:58,542
Are you crazy!

1219
01:16:58,542 --> 01:16:59,333
I'll use leaves.

1220
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:00,458
Wait. Stop!

1221
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:02,125
Gosh.

1222
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:09,542
Here.

1223
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,250
Man, Comme des Garçons?

1224
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,292
Yeah.

1225
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:14,958
What are you gonna wear?

1226
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,250
Just wipe, will you?

1227
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,667
Thank you.

1228
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,792
You're welcome.

1229
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,708
Mum, look. Naked dude!

1230
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,375
Hello, Ted.

1231
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:57,583
I'm not going back to work yet.

1232
01:17:58,042 --> 01:17:59,500
The doc told me not to walk a lot.

1233
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:03,000
Have you done mixing the song?

1234
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,667
All right. Send it over, I'll listen to it.

1235
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,500
Okay.

1236
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:10,667
I miss you too.

1237
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:12,042
Bye.

1238
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,750
When are you gonna give your Ted-talk?

1239
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,833
Not right now.

1240
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,292
When then?

1241
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:25,625
Are you going to keep flying around with me?

1242
01:18:27,292 --> 01:18:27,833
Huh?

1243
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,458
Here...

1244
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:29,792
listen.

1245
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,792
The Chinese version.

1246
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,292
You like to use Chinese, right?

1247
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,250
Is she listening to me?

1248
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:51,833
I used to like this song a lot.

1249
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,083
It's fun.

1250
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,167
But now I really hate it.

1251
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:09,958
Do you like shitting in the woods?

1252
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:13,333
Right?

1253
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,875
And jumping onto signs like Jackie Chan

1254
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:21,500
When you fall down, you're a clutz again

1255
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,750
I don't want to see you going crazy like this

1256
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:28,375
Like this

1257
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:32,083
Can't you just find a good guy for once?

1258
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:36,083
But if you can't then stay with me…

1259
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:40,208
for the time being. Can you?

1260
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,292
This is a newer version.

1261
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:47,667
The lyrics are really good.

1262
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,250
You like it now?

1263
01:19:58,042 --> 01:19:58,792
Hold it.

1264
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,625
What a feeling!

1265
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:33,667
Let's go drink in my room.

1266
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:06,083
100.

1267
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,250
190.

1268
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,917
100.

1269
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,000
190.

1270
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:34,208
100.

1271
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:36,500
190.

1272
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:38,458
190!

1273
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:40,958
Take it or leave it.

1274
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:41,875
I'll take it.

1275
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,750
Make up your mind.

1276
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:07,792
I bought some snacks.

1277
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:09,500
Okay.

1278
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Come in.

1279
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,167
I've always wanted to do this.

1280
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:50,542
Beer spa.

1281
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,208
Why don't you...

1282
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,458
come and chill together?

1283
01:22:59,042 --> 01:22:59,917
C'mon.

1284
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,125
Oh…

1285
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,250
Okay.

1286
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,417
Oh shit.

1287
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,333
Hold on.

1288
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,000
My jeans are stuck.

1289
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,917
I thought we were gonna drink beer.

1290
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:43,458
Am I supposed to drink it from the tub?

1291
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:56,583
You know…

1292
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,917
beer nourishes our hair?

1293
01:23:58,708 --> 01:23:59,875
It gets rid of the chemicals.

1294
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:01,375
You're always stylin' your hair.

1295
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:02,792
Turn around.

1296
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,042
I'll do it.

1297
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,583
Okay.

1298
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:12,875
Lay back.

1299
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,500
Rest on my legs.

1300
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,792
Is this okay?

1301
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,000
Do you like it?

1302
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,208
Are you drunk?

1303
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,500
I'm not drunk.

1304
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:21,250
I can't do this.

1305
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:25,542
It's okay.

1306
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,458
I understand.

1307
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:29,542
We've always been friends.

1308
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,208
Stuff like this takes time.

1309
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,458
Let's take it one step at a time.

1310
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,375
Why can he do it, but I can't?

1311
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,500
Clear things up with him first.

1312
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:54,417
Don't use me to get back at him!

1313
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:56,167
It's too f*cked up!

1314
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,833
How about when you flirt with me?

1315
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:03,042
You think I don't know?

1316
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,000
I want you to feel better.

1317
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:06,708
Is that all?

1318
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,500
What about that thing in your pocket?

1319
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,375
I'm not sure you see me as a friend anymore.

1320
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,542
I really wanna get up.

1321
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:20,250
But you know why I can't?

1322
01:26:20,292 --> 01:26:20,750
Why?

1323
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,083
I've got a hard-on!

1324
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:23,583
Damn you.

1325
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,250
If we weren't friends, I'd have my way with you by now.

1326
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,083
Stop it.

1327
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,000
If I let you, there be no way you'd resist.

1328
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:35,417
Let's stop being friends then!

1329
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,167
Is this how you want it?

1330
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,333
Come back in!

1331
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:39,250
Come in here!

1332
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,000
Don't taunt me!

1333
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:49,042
You're so brainless.

1334
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,583
If I were Ted, I'd cheat on you too.

1335
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,167
Is this how you want it?

1336
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:02,167
Is it?

1337
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:04,667
Then go for it.

1338
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:05,792
C'mon!

1339
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:07,125
Do it!

1340
01:27:12,292 --> 01:27:13,417
You know I love you.

1341
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,292
So, you do whatever you want?

1342
01:27:26,792 --> 01:27:27,375
Palm.

1343
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,458
Hey.

1344
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:37,583
Palm.

1345
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:39,417
I'm sorry for taking it out on you.

1346
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,667
Before you do anything, think about it first.

1347
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:54,167
If you don't really feel it, don't act on it, okay?

1348
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,292
Who said I don’t feel it?

1349
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:39,917
I'll break up with Ted.

1350
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:06,708
If you don't break up, I'll kiss you.

1351
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:10,125
Sure.

1352
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,125
If I do, you have to take me to Europe.

1353
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,667
See the Northern Lights. Eat caviar. 5-star hotels.

1354
01:29:22,792 --> 01:29:23,583
Deal?

1355
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:26,917
What a long list.

1356
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:29,000
It can be anywhere...

1357
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
as long as I'm with you.

1358
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:37,667
Okay.

1359
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:38,583
Deal.

1360
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:45,125
Gink.

1361
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:46,958
Yes?

1362
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:57,458
After you're done with Ted,

1363
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:58,958
see you at Shwedagon.

1364
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,292
Sure.

1365
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,208
Before you say anything

1366
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:15,917
I want you to promise me

1367
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,833
That you won't let me down

1368
01:30:19,167 --> 01:30:22,250
Is our love still as good as before?

1369
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,042
Are we still together in our dreams?

1370
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:29,708
Your heart hasn't changed

1371
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:33,542
And our love is still the same

1372
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:34,500
What's wrong?

1373
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,542
Nothing.

1374
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:42,792
Really.

1375
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,583
You forgot your watch?

1376
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:51,750
Yeah.

1377
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:52,875
Sorry.

1378
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,833
So...

1379
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,917
Any comments on my singing?

1380
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:04,125
Sorry...

1381
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:07,042
I'll be there one second.

1382
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:13,250
There.

1383
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:16,375
This line here.

1384
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:17,000
Here.

1385
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,458
And... Here.

1386
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:21,583
You're also long-sighted just like me.

1387
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,333
No, I'm not. I'm just mocking you.

1388
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,500
Oh! You're so mean.

1389
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,875
I know.

1390
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:27,792
Okay and...

1391
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:29,958
The last word.

1392
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:31,458
You have to sing like original.

1393
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:33,625
Oh, I forgot again.

1394
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:34,667
Try it.

1395
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:39,208
Yes. Don't you remember?

1396
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,917
I didn't forget.

1397
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,417
But I threw it away!

1398
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:46,250
Threw what?

1399
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,417
The guilt gift you bought me!

1400
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:53,625
I don't understand.

1401
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:54,333
Who?

1402
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:57,458
Who? What?

1403
01:31:57,542 --> 01:31:59,250
In Hong Kong, I spied on you.

1404
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:00,833
Who did you get in the taxi with?

1405
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,250
Tell me!

1406
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:08,208
A singer?

1407
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:09,208
Manager?

1408
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:09,917
Interpreter?

1409
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,833
From Tinder?

1410
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:11,875
Who?!

1411
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,958
I'd better go get my glasses in the car.

1412
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,333
Yeah. Yeah. I'll help you go find it.

1413
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,292
Calm down, Gink.

1414
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:38,000
I went with Poupe.

1415
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:41,375
Which Poupe?

1416
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,250
The girl you sang the duet with.

1417
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:47,083
She flew over for a trip.

1418
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:48,875
So, we went out for dinner.

1419
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:54,125
And...

1420
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,833
You told me you'd go back to the hotel but didn't.

1421
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,458
Why didn't you answer my calls?

1422
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,208
Poupe and I used to like each other during uni.

1423
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:14,125
After we played music together at the wedding…

1424
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:16,917
we keep in touch.

1425
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:22,500
And...

1426
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:24,750
when you didn't come with me to record...

1427
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,167
Poupe flew out to see me.

1428
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:32,625
At first, we were…

1429
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,583
gonna just hang out.

1430
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:41,792
But things got out of hand.

1431
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,208
Why didn't you tell me…

1432
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:06,167
after dinner, you went separate ways.

1433
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,167
And...

1434
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,708
you're so drunk you stayed at hostel instead.

1435
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:15,042
You didn't answer my calls because you fell asleep.

1436
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:18,542
Or you answered the call when you had to pee.

1437
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:21,000
Can't you make up excuses?

1438
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,417
I don't want to wrong you anymore.

1439
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:34,458
I've told you before…

1440
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:37,083
I don't like this kind of person.

1441
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:41,583
I won't take it anymore.

1442
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:48,667
I know.

1443
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,708
I don't want to let you go.

1444
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:09,417
What's up, Mong Palm?

1445
01:36:10,292 --> 01:36:11,375
Mong Gink.

1446
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,583
Do they also call girls, 'mong'?

1447
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:19,792
Here.

1448
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:21,417
Light the candle.

1449
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,833
Make a wish.

1450
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:25,333
Then light the other end and put it down.

1451
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,333
Ted didn't cheat on you?

1452
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:57,417
I want to give him another chance.

1453
01:37:06,708 --> 01:37:07,625
Damn you.

1454
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:12,958
Being friends is good enough, right?

1455
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:15,583
Gink.

1456
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,708
You want us to be just friends?

1457
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,792
Friends, my ass!

1458
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,708
Are we really just friends?

1459
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:23,542
You coming here to see me…

1460
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:25,125
what did you tell Ted?

1461
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,583
Did you tell him that you're here to see me?

1462
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:33,417
Did you even mention my name?

1463
01:37:39,792 --> 01:37:40,667
See?

1464
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,875
Palm.

1465
01:37:48,042 --> 01:37:48,833
Palm.

1466
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:53,292
You're very important to me.

1467
01:37:53,375 --> 01:37:55,625
If we were a couple and broke up, then what?

1468
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:57,708
Who knows if we'd break up or not?

1469
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,417
Do you know the future?

1470
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:04,458
I don't want to risk you.

1471
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:15,625
I shouldn't have asked you to be just friends.

1472
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,542
If not, would we have lasted this long?

1473
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:29,083
I really can't stay any longer.

1474
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,167
One day if you have a girlfriend…

1475
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:36,667
we can be friends again, right?

1476
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:44,333
Right?

1477
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,125
If you take one more step, I'll kiss you!

1478
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:18,792
5 missed calls

1479
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:45,125
It's the worst breakup I've ever had...

1480
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,792
even though we weren't a couple.

1481
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:59,250
You guys don't have to get carried away.

1482
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:01,542
Are you saying...

1483
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:04,042
no matter how long we wait…

1484
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,958
there's no happy ending for us, right?

1485
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:11,083
If you cross the line...

1486
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:13,583
there's no going back.

1487
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:15,333
How can you handle it?

1488
01:40:16,417 --> 01:40:18,875
When the text says read but there's no reply...

1489
01:40:20,042 --> 01:40:21,125
I can't sleep.

1490
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,333
I can't imagine my life without her.

1491
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:29,667
How can you do it?

1492
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,000
I had to start over...

1493
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:38,583
with new people.

1494
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:57,917
Hey.

1495
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,042
Are you making a wish or cursing me?

1496
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:04,042
Palm.

1497
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:06,375
Palm.

1498
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,417
Why are you looking at me?

1499
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:09,333
Did you wish for me?

1500
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:14,000
You shouldn't tell anyone about the wish.

1501
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,042
It won't come true.

1502
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:16,500
Oh, okay.

1503
01:41:28,083 --> 01:41:28,500
Hey.

1504
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,125
What?

1505
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:31,417
Buy 3 get 1 free.

1506
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,250
Don't you have high cholesterol?

1507
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:33,958
It's okay.

1508
01:41:34,042 --> 01:41:35,292
One strip makes my day.

1509
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:37,292
One strip or one pack!

1510
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:42,250
This pack is for our beef stroganoff.

1511
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:44,292
It's a Russian must-have.

1512
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:45,833
This pack…

1513
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:48,542
I'm going to make spaghetti and bacon with dried chilies.

1514
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:50,292
Made with Thai flavours.

1515
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:14,750
The ad came out early, huh?

1516
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:30,792
Are you Jackie Chan or what?

1517
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:42,250
Why are you so mean?

1518
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:46,417
You know I overthink things

1519
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,708
It makes my heart jittery

1520
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:53,833
Who will take responsibility?

1521
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,083
I want to tell you

1522
01:42:57,167 --> 01:43:01,000
How anxious I am

1523
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:02,958
Before you say anything

1524
01:43:03,042 --> 01:43:05,167
I want you to promise me

1525
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:08,292
That you won't make me cry

1526
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:12,083
Do you like shitting in the woods?

1527
01:43:12,292 --> 01:43:15,458
Are we still together in our dreams?

1528
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:19,292
Your heart hasn’t changed

1529
01:43:19,542 --> 01:43:22,917
And our love is still the same

1530
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:26,625
All I want is for you to say it

1531
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,333
Tell me that you think it

1532
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:34,000
Tell me. So I am sure

1533
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:38,000
That our love is still the same

1534
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,500
Am I right?

1535
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:45,625
Goong-Gink.

1536
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:48,708
Why are you smiling?

1537
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,625
Huh?

1538
01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:53,667
What are you smiling about?

1539
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,500
What are you thinking?

1540
01:43:55,292 --> 01:43:56,833
Tell me now.

1541
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:58,667
Not telling?

1542
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:12,292
I admit…

1543
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:15,458
even when dating someone new...

1544
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,875
I can't help but compare them to her.

1545
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:22,083
So, I stopped talking to them all.

1546
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:25,208
If I had to be friends with her...

1547
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:27,417
that's also unacceptable.

1548
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:30,333
Palm.

1549
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:34,375
Trust me.

1550
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,500
Don't turn around.

1551
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:36,333
Gink?

1552
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:37,458
Don't!

1553
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,500
Gink, right?

1554
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:42,583
That's enough.

1555
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:44,708
I think you should go your own ways.

1556
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:46,583
I know it's not my place.

1557
01:44:47,375 --> 01:44:48,292
But…

1558
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:50,250
you should stop bothering him.

1559
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,917
Or pretend you're still friends with him.

1560
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,458
You need to understand…

1561
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:57,083
he can't be friends with you.

1562
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,542
He can't be friends.

1563
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:06,125
I don't want to be his friend either.

1564
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,667
What do you want?

1565
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:52,083
I broke up with Ted!

1566
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:57,125
Why?

1567
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:58,292
Did he cheat again?

1568
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,250
No, he didn't.

1569
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:11,083
I wanna see the Northern Lights with you.

1570
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,375
I need to ask you one question.

1571
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:23,458
And I won't ask you again.

1572
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:26,917
What?

1573
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:28,292
You and I…

1574
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:29,958
if we can't be friends anymore...

1575
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,208
let's get married, okay?

1576
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:35,750
Say again?!

1577
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:38,542
Will you marry me?!

1578
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:39,833
I didn't hear you!

1579
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:41,583
I said…

1580
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:48,625
You!

1581
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:13,125
Are you okay?

1582
01:47:18,875 --> 01:47:20,833
I told her no marriage license.

1583
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:23,500
In the end, she made me sign it.

1584
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:25,583
Damn!

1585
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:27,125
Whoa!

1586
01:47:27,292 --> 01:47:27,958
Man.

1587
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:29,958
I'm so happy for you!

1588
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:35,625
Nothing is impossible.

1589
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,208
Your one decade didn't go to waste.

1590
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:40,500
You know…

1591
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:42,625
that we have always thought…

1592
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,375
that…

1593
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:48,042
the longer we wait, the less hope we have.

1594
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,583
The longer we're together,

1595
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:52,292
the harder it gets to cut the ties.

1596
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:10,708
My friend's been waiting.

1597
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:12,500
I need to get this to her.

1598
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:18,500
See you around.

1599
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:20,833
Nice talking to you.

1600
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:22,458
Same here.

1601
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:35,625
What did you brag about?

1602
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,083
Beer slushie, right?

1603
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,750
Had to chill it first.

1604
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:47,667
It's already a slushie. Don't even.

1605
01:48:49,458 --> 01:48:50,667
Just giving them a pep talk.

1606
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:56,542
Thanks.

1607
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:57,125
Yeah.

1608
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,292
Cheers.

1609
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,917
Get your friend to bring it.

1610
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:13,500
Yeah.

1611
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,000
Where have you been?

1612
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,167
To get your beer.

1613
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,542
Thanks.

1614
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:46,125
Gink.

1615
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:46,833
Huh?

1616
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:47,958
Your ring?

1617
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:56,208
It must have fallen off when I was dancing.

1618
01:49:59,375 --> 01:49:59,875
Shit!

1619
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:01,750
Calm down, Gink.

1620
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:02,875
It's me, Ju.

1621
01:50:02,958 --> 01:50:03,667
What are you looking for?

1622
01:50:03,792 --> 01:50:04,750
The wedding ring.

1623
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:05,917
You lost my wedding ring?!

1624
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,208
Look at your finger first.

1625
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:08,375
Oh, It's here!

1626
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,500
I'll help look.

1627
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:11,542
Honey, help us.

1628
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:13,333
Help us look, please.

1629
01:50:14,917 --> 01:50:16,708
Help us look for her wedding ring.

1630
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,083
A wedding ring.

1631
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:22,125
Could you please look for it?

1632
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:33,875
Found it!

1633
01:50:39,625 --> 01:50:40,708
How'd it get over there?

1634
01:50:40,792 --> 01:50:41,333
I dunno.

1635
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:44,417
What?

1636
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:45,875
You proposed to me first.

1637
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:47,708
Let me propose to you.

1638
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,917
Palm.

1639
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,208
Get up.

1640
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:51,250
Let me propose first.

1641
01:50:51,333 --> 01:50:52,667
Don’t joke around. Everyone's looking.

1642
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:55,292
Palm, I said don't fool around.

1643
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:04,458
Be with me forever, okay?

1644
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:07,208
Of course.

1645
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:11,375
What?

1646
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,000
Get up.

1647
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:12,875
Are you crazy?

1648
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,208
Why can't I be like them?

1649
01:51:23,917 --> 01:51:25,000
Go dump him.

1650
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:27,500
I'm giddy.

1651
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:30,208
Giddy for you.

1652
01:52:01,525 --> 01:52:11,525
- Drafeir -

1653
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:27,875
Ahh! Super cold!

1654
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,500
Goong-Gink. Goong-Gink.

1655
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,375
It's like you're playing with a dog.

1656
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:39,042
Damn it!

1657
01:53:39,708 --> 01:53:40,500
Oh no!

1658
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,917
Just go be with her!

1659
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:46,833
Luis!

1660
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:48,292
Damn scary!

1661
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:53,250
Is this your first time to Krabi?

1662
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:54,458
Oh, we're just friends.

1663
01:53:57,542 --> 01:53:59,083
What did I ask her?

1664
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:03,625
You look so evil.

1665
01:54:06,375 --> 01:54:07,375
It's all right, bro.

1666
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,750
Dude. Almost kissed me.

1667
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:10,000
No one stopped him.

1668
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:12,208
10 years!

1669
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:14,375
More.

1670
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:15,083
10 years!

1671
01:54:16,208 --> 01:54:17,083
Too normal.

1672
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:17,833
10 years!

1673
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:19,042
I don't believe you.

1674
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:25,500
I'll keep doing it.

1675
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:51,042
One.

1676
01:54:51,167 --> 01:54:51,833
Two.

1677
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:52,708
Three.

1678
01:54:53,708 --> 01:55:00,000
You wonder if I can be alone or not

1679
01:55:00,833 --> 01:55:03,042
I just want to ask just one question

1680
01:55:03,042 --> 01:55:06,625
Just tell me I wanna know

1681
01:55:06,917 --> 01:55:10,042
Do I have a choice?

1682
01:55:10,333 --> 01:55:14,042
Can I choose for you not to leave?

1683
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:20,500
If I don't let you go, will you stay?

1684
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:23,792
I'd choose you to choose me

1685
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:27,750
Not to leave me, would you?

1686
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:34,250
What you asked, what should I say?

1687
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:38,208
When I have no choice at all

1688
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:54,875
You're here to ask like you truly care

1689
01:55:56,250 --> 01:56:01,250
Will I be okay when you are gone?

1690
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:07,375
Someone is waiting for you over there

1691
01:56:08,625 --> 01:56:13,667
You don't want them to be waiting for long

1692
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:20,208
You wonder if I can be alone or not

1693
01:56:20,833 --> 01:56:22,833
I just want to ask just one question

1694
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:26,208
Just tell me I wanna know

1695
01:56:26,417 --> 01:56:29,375
Do I have a choice?

1696
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:33,167
Can I choose for you not to leave?

1697
01:56:33,792 --> 01:56:39,375
If I don't let you go, will you stay?

1698
01:56:39,542 --> 01:56:42,625
I'd choose you to choose me

1699
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:46,333
Not to leave me, would you?

1700
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:52,625
What you asked, what should I say?

1701
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:56,417
When I have no choice at all

1702
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:58,625
Thank you.

1703
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:00,000
You asked is it off key or not?

1704
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:02,958
I gotta say very badly!
