1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,634
You're getting out today, huh?

2
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,503
That's what we heard.

3
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:24,107
Why are you so quiet, huh?

4
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:29,145
Who was all mouth the other day
when I confronted you in the showers?

5
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,081
Lost my yard privileges 'cause of you.

6
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,066
Hey, it's Stef,

7
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,868
I'm either working or avoiding your...

8
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,137
Hi, Lena?

9
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,006
I'm David.

10
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,776
Uh... where's Bill?

11
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,678
I just spoke with him, he's
supposed to meet with me here.

12
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,680
Um, yeah, Bill. One of his cases...

13
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,615
Well, a kid in one of
his foster homes OD'd,

14
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,750
so he had to rush to the hospital.

15
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,618
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, it's terrible.

16
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,420
- I take it he told you about Callie?
- Yes.

17
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:45,788
Yes, well, it seems that she's been having

18
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,624
a few issues with male
authority figures, of late.

19
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,493
- Which is...
- That's why he thought of us.

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,529
- Right.
- So, she got into a fight with her foster father?

21
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:56,399
And damaged some of his property,
which is how she landed here in juvie.

22
00:01:56,433 --> 00:02:01,104
Damaged his property. Uh... Wow. David...

23
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,172
Bill and I have known each
other for a very long time,

24
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,274
and he's been a friend of the family
ever since he placed the twins with us,

25
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,311
but I cannot bring someone
violent into my house.

26
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,345
I've got my own kids to think about.

27
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,913
No, this was just a one time thing.

28
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,281
Listen, it'll only just be for a few weeks.

29
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,153
- Oh my goodness.
- Um...

30
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,790
When the kids get out, some of the other
inmates get jealous and pick fights.

31
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,725
- One second. One second?
- But...

32
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,827
Callie? Callie, hi.

33
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,663
I'm David, I work with Bill
at Child Protective Services.

34
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,832
Um... where's Jude? Do
you know where he is?

35
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,868
- I don't know...
- I need to speak to him.

36
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,469
Where's Bill? Why isn't Bill here?

37
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:34,837
We'll have to talk about that later.

38
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:37,507
I just, I don't understand
why I can't talk to Jude.

39
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,643
That's enough. I don't know
what you're talking about.

40
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:45,414
Callie, this is Lena. Lena, Callie.

41
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,354
I guess I could take her
to one of the group homes.

42
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,798
It's just for a few weeks, right?

43
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,905
Ok.

44

45
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:25,121
So, Mariana and Jesus were
in the foster program, too.

46
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,790
They came to us about eight years ago,

47
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:31,060
and we formally adopted
them five years ago.

48
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,930
- Foster system sucks.
- Jesus...

49
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,097
He's right. It kind of does.

50
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,833
- Ok.
- What happened to your face?

51
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,135
- Get in a fight?
- Uh...

52
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,870
Callie's kind of had a rough day.

53
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,872
So, how about we cool
it with the third degree.

54
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:45,775
Is there... where's the bathroom?

55
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,743
Yeah, it's right through
there. You'll see it.

56
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,184
So... where'd she come from?

57
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,689
Um... I, I talked to Bill

58
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,158
from Child Protective
Services, you remember him?

59
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:05,995
To talk to him about something and he...

60
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,930
you know, he was in a bind with Callie.

61
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,866
And he needed some place for her to stay.

62
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,070
She's had a rough time lately, so, I really
need you guys to be extra nice to her.

63
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,706
- Please?
- What were you talking to Bill about?

64
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,074
Guess.

65
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,713
All right, so I was going to
wait till everyone was home

66
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,915
to talk to you guys
about this. Have a seat.

67
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:33,923
I was calling to find out when we could
set up a meeting with your birth mom.

68
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:41,897
I thought you would be more excited.

69
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,934
This is kind of all you've been
talking about for the last six months.

70
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,937
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

71
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,173
I did, just... I don't think so.

72
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,877
Did Jesus talk you out of this?

73
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,680
- Just because he doesn't want to go...
- Don't look at me.

74
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,716
No, I just... changed my mind is all.

75
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,672
Ok, so did you guys do your homework?

76
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,643
What? Why you gotta look at me like that?

77
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:29,645
Just 'cause you get straight
A's and you don't have to study?

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,547
Jesus, everyone has their strengths.

79
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,317
- Hey. Hey, guys.
- Hey! How was the audition?

80
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,485
It was good, it was
good. I made the finals.

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,454
Oh, my God!

82
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,090
- That's fantastic.
- It's not that big of a deal.

83
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,258
It is a huge deal. Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,193
That's like a 5,000 dollar
scholarship, isn't it?

85
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,228
- When is it?
- It's tomorrow and we're all going

86
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,230
So, homework right after school, please?

87
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,067
Who's this?

88
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,604
Oh, this is Callie.

89
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,945
She's going to be staying
with us for a little while.

90
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,939
Oh, ok. Staying with us.

91
00:05:56,973 --> 00:06:00,910
Um, nice to meet you.

92
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,645
What about him?

93
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:03,813
What?

94
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,748
How'd you get him?

95
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,783
99 Cent Store? I mean,
they have everything there.

96
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:12,755
Um, Brandon is my partner Stephanie's
biological son from her previous marriage.

97
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,391
- Hey honey.
- Hi.

98
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,294
It smells great. Lasagna.
Delicious, thank you.

99
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:20,262
- How are you, honey?
- Good, how are you?

100
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,364
Hi babies!

101
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:23,532
What? Nobody told you our mom's a cop?

102
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,202
See, this is why no boys
ever want to come over.

103
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,105
- As it should be.
- So, you're dykes.

104
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,876
They prefer the term "people,"

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,144
but yeah, they're gay.

106
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,146
And he's the real son.

107
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,020
And who's this?

108
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,893
I tried calling you several times.

109
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,830
Yes, I know. You never left a message.

110
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,798
What was I going to say
in a message about this?

111
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,568
What do we know about this girl
that we're bringing into our house,

112
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,437
with our children? What
happened to her face?

113
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,506
She got beat up in juvie.

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,442
- In juvie? Lena...
- I know, I know!

115
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,244
I talked to Bill.

116
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,246
She's not violent, she's
not dangerous in any way.

117
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,117
- This was a one time thing.
- Honey, we can't save them all.

118
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,119
It's just for a few weeks.

119
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,087
I'm telling you, if you had been there,

120
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,223
and seen the way this girl looked at me.

121
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:24,192
Honey, I know you only did this
out of the goodness of your heart,

122
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,062
and I can't get mad at you for that, can I?

123
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,930
Oh, mushy.

124
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,199
I ought to... bring kids home more often.

125
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,769
Oh, please do not, 'cause any more kids,

126
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,103
it's gonna be like The
Brady Bunch around here,

127
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:39,808
and we're... we're definitely
not The Brady Bunch.

128
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,744
The curfew on school night is seven.

129
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,814
You must ask permission from Lena
or myself before leaving the house.

130
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,583
Also, you'll go to school
while you're staying here.

131
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:52,788
Lena is the Vice Principal of
Anchor Beach Charter School,

132
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,557
- All the kids go there...
- Where do I sleep?

133
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,693
Excuse me?

134
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,296
It's not my first time in a foster home.

135
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,464
Where do I sleep?

136
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,534
Let me show you.

137
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,377
One pillow or two?

138
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,149
Ok, I'll leave them both.

139
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:25,287
I left some towels for you in the
bathroom and do you have a toothbrush?

140
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,790
No, I don't have a toothbrush.

141
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,792
How would I have gotten a toothbrush?

142
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,761
Ok.

143
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,764
Callie, we're on your side.

144
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:38,800
You can take it down a notch, ok?

145
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,605
Yeah.

146
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,746
I noticed you were really upset when
you were talking to David earlier.

147
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,548
Who's Jude?

148
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,122
Look...

149
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,126
When I went into juvie...

150
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,361
Hey, here are some clothes
for you to sleep in.

151
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,363
Tonight, if you want to leave your
clothes outside of the bathroom,

152
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:11,133
I'll wash and make sure
they're clean for tomorrow, ok?

153
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,936
Good night.

154
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,841
You were saying?

155
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,713
You have that toothbrush?

156
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:34,990
__

157
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,926
Oh, hey, you guys know the rules.

158
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,928
__

159
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,831
- Ah, very good.
- Gracias, senor.

160
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:50,372
Hey, you two know that it's
not true what Callie said, huh?

161
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:55,377
You two are every bit as much
our kids as Brandon is, yes?

162
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,579
- We know.
- Miss Thing?

163
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,283
Ok.

164
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,419
- I love you, my babies.
- Good night.

165
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,088
Mm, 15 minutes till lights out, ok?

166
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,723
- Hey baby.
- Hey.

167
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:45,594
Hey. B, listen. Um...

168
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,730
I really need you to step up while
Callie is in this house, all right?

169
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,635
Um, I don't want to make
a big deal about this,

170
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,238
especially with Mariana and Jesus,

171
00:10:56,272 --> 00:11:00,408
but between you and me, Callie
was in juvie for a little while.

172
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:03,211
Then what is she doing in the house?

173
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,447
She's fine.

174
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,182
Lena and I would not have her in this house

175
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,918
if she was not, you know that.

176
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,054
So, I just need you to, I don't know...

177
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,091
Ok. All right, well, I'll be sure to...

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,859
"I don't know" as much as I can.

179
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:22,097
Are you sure you're not
Lena's biological son?

180
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,065
I've got so much homework to do now,

181
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,901
Moby-Dick waits for no man.

182
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,004
Oh, which reminds me, do you need condoms?

183
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,806
- Oh, my God.
- You and Talya are using condoms, yeah?

184
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,675
Yeah, the door is right there.

185
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,910
What? Protect and serve. That's my job.

186
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,745
- Mom.
- Ok.

187
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,782
My little baby is
growing up. He's such a...

188
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:44,319
- Get out.
- ... handsome young man.

189
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,106
I needed some water.

190
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,648
Thank you.

191
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,287
Ok, so I've been thinking...

192
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,289
and I know how mad I would've been

193
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:58,159
if you would've made such a huge
decision without consulting me.

194
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,328
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

195
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,098
All right? I'm ok. She's not exactly the...

196
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:05,000
the warmest kid I've ever met.

197
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,804
I really appreciate you making the effort.

198
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,139
It means a lot to me.

199
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,174
Of course, my love.

200
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,814
You know, I just think that poor girl has

201
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:23,018
just been through so much.

202
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,754
I'm just really glad we can
give her a place to stay.

203
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:26,921
You know, that's safe.

204
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,524
- For now.
- For now...

205
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,926
As long as she doesn't mess
with our family. It's all good.

206
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,462
Now get off my side, please.

207
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,897
Ok, mama tiger.

208
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,637
Do you want to hear something strange?

209
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,373
Sure.

210
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,244
I talked to the twins about

211
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,513
arranging a visit with their
birth mom, like we talked about.

212
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,214
Mm-hm?

213
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,418
And now, neither one
of them wants to do it.

214
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,454
- Not even Mariana?
- Nope.

215
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,456
She says she's not ready.

216
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,194
Good.

217
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,479
Hey, hey baby, it's me.

218
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,081
Yeah, I'm out and I... I'm coming.

219
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:04,285
I promise, Jude. I just, I got
to figure out how to get there.

220
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,240
Did you take your pill, sweet knuckle head?

221
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,075
- I'm on it.
- Really? Like you're on the toast?

222
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,410
- Let's go, let's go.
- Thank you.

223
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:17,946
Whoa, whoa. I know you got a
sweater to go over that, baby.

224
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:19,081
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

225
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:21,250
Good morning, sunshine.
Orange juice on the table,

226
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,185
help yourself. Make yourself at home.

227
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,154
Ok, backpacks? Backpacks?

228
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,790
- Yes, I saw Mariana's.
- Can everyone give me a yes?

229
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,825
Jesus? Backpack. Where is it?

230
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,795
- Mm.
- Good job, baby, good job.

231
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:34,163
So, you nervous for tonight?

232
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,898
I'm not nervous, I got it.

233
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,133
You totally are.

234
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,868
It's all good.

235
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,603
I heard that pep talk...

236
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,577
Would you like some cream?

237
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,482
Uh, can I have some coffee, too?

238
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:55,351
No.

239
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,271
Hey Brandon, why don't
you show Callie around?

240
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:18,073
She's starting the day in Timothy's class.

241
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,441
You have your class list, Callie?

242
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,276
You're going to love
Timothy. He's a lot of fun.

243
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,859
You go to school here?

244
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,027
Yeah. Um...

245
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,867
So, Timothy's room...

246
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,636
it's over there, you'll find it ok, right?

247
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,838
I got like, 20 minutes before
class. So I wanted to go practice.

248
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:51,673
Practice for what?

249
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,710
The music finals for
the competition tonight.

250
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,845
- Right.
- All right. Well, see ya.

251
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,318
Hey, wait up!

252
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:15,197
- What is that?
- What? The song?

253
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:18,367
- Oh, I wrote it.
- You wrote it.

254
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,469
Yep, it's for the contest.

255
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:22,237
You need one classical piece,

256
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:23,405
and one original composition.

257
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:27,910
It's about the night Mom and Lena asked me

258
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,112
if it was ok for the twins
to come and live with us.

259
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:34,149
How is it about that?
Doesn't have any words.

260
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,784
Listen.

261
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,086
Ok, so...

262
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:41,089
That's me.

263
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:46,728
And...

264
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:52,634
These are my moms.

265
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,338
This is all of us. This is me, mom,

266
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:59,608
Lena, the twins...

267
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,477
See, how it all works better?

268
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,345
Nice.

269
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,614
Yeah... I don't know.

270
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,616
I still think it's missing something.

271
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,251
No, I like it.

272
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:12,221
Wait, they asked you if the
twins could move in with you?

273
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:15,090
Were you going to say no?

274
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,458
Nah, I mean,

275
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,327
I don't know, I figured
there was enough to go around.

276
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,029
Enough of what?

277
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,131
Everything.

278
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,299
Hey baby.

279
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,069
- Hey, what's up?
- How are you?

280
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,971
I'm good... how are you?

281
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:30,839
I'm good.

282
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,808
Who's this?

283
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,878
Uh, this is Callie. Callie, this is Talya.

284
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:38,881
She's going to be staying
with us for awhile.

285
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,783
- Welcome to Anchor Beach.
- Thanks.

286
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,685
She's actually in
Timothy's room with you, T.

287
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,921
So, if you want to... show her where it is.

288
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,624
Oh yeah, of course. But we should go.

289
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,859
Have fun.

290
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:54,329
Did he participate in
his own transformation?

291
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,764
Did he will it?

292
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,666
Did he want it to happen?

293
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,236
Or, was it something that happened to him?

294
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:04,239
How about you, Callie? Callie?

295
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:09,111
I know you haven't read
the material yet, but...

296
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,480
what would you do if you suddenly woke up

297
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:15,317
and found yourself living a nightmare.

298
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,388
- Hey.
- Hey, so...

299
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:22,190
I've been thinking and
I'm going to go with you.

300
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,293
- What?
- To meet Ana. I'll go with you, if you want.

301
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:26,128
But, you don't even want to meet her.

302
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:27,996
Yeah, I know.

303
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:33,168
Look, I told you, I don't think I'm ready.

304
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,938
Yeah, I know. That's why
I'm trying to go with you.

305
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,906
No, thank you.

306
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:42,711
Hey! Hey!

307
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:47,583
- Hi, what's your name?
- Aiden.

308
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,852
Aiden, right. Nice to meet you.

309
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:54,856
- Uh, you new here?
- Yeah. Yep. New girl.

310
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:57,526
Just moved here, actually.

311
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,530
I could really use
someone to show me around.

312
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,599
That can be arranged.

313
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,567
- You have a car, right?
- Yep.

314
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:08,537
Cool. Um, well, I was
actually thinking about

315
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:11,340
checking out San Ysidro this afternoon.

316
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,475
San Ysidro. Down by Tijuana?

317
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:15,544
Yeah, I hear it's cool there.

318
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:19,047
What? Are you like, looking
to party or something?

319
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,049
No...

320
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:25,187
I just have someone I need to see there.

321
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:27,222
Yeah...

322
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,995
No thanks. Good luck.

323
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:18,287
Hey, is there a Metro stop somewhere?

324
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:21,390
I'll be right back.

325
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,164
You going somewhere? Got to meet your pimp?

326
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:30,299
What is your problem?

327
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,168
Take too many of your brother's pills?

328
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:37,173
Don't worry, I'm not going to narc on you.

329
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,042
I mean, your mom's a
cop. That's got to suck.

330
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:43,312
I guess. So, are you leaving?

331
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:48,885
Don't worry. I'm not going to narc on you.

332
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,689
I just have some stuff
I've got to take care of.

333
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,759
Sorry, it's better if you don't know.

334
00:21:56,793 --> 00:22:01,998
That way, if your mom... moms
start asking you questions...

335
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:07,937
Wait. If it were me,

336
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,705
I'd make sure to go out the back way.

337
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,475
Lena's office looks out
over the front entrance

338
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,378
and there's a bus stop
three blocks from here.

339
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,417
... very long list of people who
want to get involved with this school.

340
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:23,619
It's very parental driven, we
want the parents involved...

341
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:28,391
in the process. We want them...

342
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,162
We want them involved in every step...

343
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:41,137
- Real good, all right?
- Captain needs to see you.

344
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,840
Ok. All right guys, take
it easy. I'll see you later.

345
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,275
- Hey.
- Hey, you all right?

346
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,745
- Yeah.
- You're not going to cry, are you?

347
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,080
No, with all due respect, screw you.

348
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:54,684
- Well, Vasquez was a pain in my ass!
- Amen!

349
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,752
Sacramento can have him.

350
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:59,689
Right now, since both
of you are partnerless,

351
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:02,658
starting tomorrow, I'm going
to pair you up with Mike here.

352
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,598
- Ma'am.
- Is that a problem?

353
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,669
No, that's not a problem.

354
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:16,405
- May I ask why?
- I asked.

355
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:20,443
- You did?
- Is that cool?

356
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:23,579
Uh, can I have time to think about it?

357
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:26,349
- No.
- All right, I think it's very cool.

358
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,551
- Good.
- It's a great idea on your part.

359
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:32,088
- All right.
- Get out of my office.

360
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:37,193
Mike, it's not going to go well for me.

361
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:40,062
Hey. Hey, I need some money.

362
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:42,198
Um, rude much? No,
you've got your own money.

363
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:45,768
I left my wallet at home. Come on, I
didn't eat lunch. I'm really hungry.

364
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,970
- Too bad for you.
- I'm just going to take five bucks.

365
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,105
I promise, I'll pay you back tonight.

366
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,040
- Jesus, stop!
- What is this?

367
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,843
- Nothing.
- Where'd you get that?

368
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:58,914
Don't worry about it. Here...

369
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:01,584
Here's five dollars. Now
go eat and leave me alone.

370
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:10,726
- Who's that?
- I... I don't know.

371
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,596
Well, my parents are going
out of town this weekend.

372
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,332
- Oh yeah?
- You want to stay the night?

373
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,701
I'd have to sneak out.

374
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:20,703
Or, just tell them
you're staying with Aiden.

375
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,542
- Brandon... Hey.
- Yeah, hey.

376
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:29,378
- Do you want to come?
- Two seconds. Can you give me two seconds?

377
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:54,136
So, uh... where you going?

378
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,938
I've got some stuff to take care of.

379
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,840
Stuff to take care of? Like, right now?

380
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:59,608
- It's important.
- Ok.

381
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:01,710
You won't be able to take care
of it if you end up back in juvie.

382
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:02,978
I mean, my mom's a cop.

383
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,714
You seriously think she won't
track you down in a minute flat.

384
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,851
Can you just mind your own damn
business? Your whole freakin' family?

385
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:10,953
- We're just trying to help you.
- Stop.

386
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:17,426
Somebody's been calling me
from this number all day.

387
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,627
Hey.

388
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:20,529
Hey baby, it's me. What's going on?

389
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:23,799
What do you mean?

390
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:28,671
Jude, what are you saying?

391
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,207
Let me talk to Jude.

392
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,576
Put him back on the phone.

393
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:38,047
What's going on? Who was that?

394
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:39,215
Why are they calling my number?

395
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:41,383
I borrowed your phone last night.

396
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:43,285
I gotta go.

397
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,387
So, who was that? Was that like
your boyfriend or something?

398
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:47,323
- No.
- Then who was it?

399
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:49,125
How do they have my number, Callie?

400
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:52,261
- Who is it?
- It was my brother.

401
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,799
Whoa, whoa... let me call my mom.

402
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,101
- Stef?
- Yes, she's a cop.

403
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,737
- She can help.
- No cops.

404
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:05,541
- She's not like that.
- If you call your mom,

405
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,676
she's going to look in the system
and find all of these complaints

406
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,612
that my foster father made against me.

407
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:11,447
You're going to get me sent back to juvie,

408
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,482
and Jude is going to
be stuck in that house.

409
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:16,385
I gotta go.

410
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,747
Wait, didn't you have
that music thing tonight?

411
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:52,418
Uh, yeah. It's... don't worry about it.

412
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:53,519
There'll be others.

413
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,357
So, what happened?

414
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,592
At the house?

415
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,298
Well, my foster father
caught my little brother

416
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,500
wearing one of his ex-wife's dresses.

417
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:10,136
Started beating the crap out of him.

418
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,305
Seriously? He hit him?

419
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,242
Yeah. I mean, he used
to hit me all the time,

420
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:18,344
but, you know, whatever.

421
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,849
But, when I saw him going after Jude...

422
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:26,219
I just... well, I tried to stop him,

423
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,987
but he kicked me in the stomach.

424
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,990
So, I went outside, grabbed a baseball bat,

425
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,826
beat the hell out of his precious Trans Am.

426
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,631
The cops came. He told
them that I went crazy,

427
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,533
and he was defending himself.

428
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:45,438
Nobody seemed to care much
about my side of the story.

429
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:51,744
Hey sweetheart.

430
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,747
You ok?

431
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:58,484
I just... I don't feel
so good. My stomach hurts.

432
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,520
I don't think I'm going to be able
to go to Brandon's thing tonight.

433
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,288
What, you feel like
you're going to throw up?

434
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:05,224
No, I just... I think
I just ate something bad.

435
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,126
I really need to lie down.

436
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:11,297
Ok. Well, yeah, go lie down and
we'll see how you feel later.

437
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:20,873
Hey, so, what's going on with Mariana?

438
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,810
- What do you mean?
- Um, why is she pretending to be sick?

439
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:26,112
I don't know. Maybe she's actually sick?

440
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,814
Or it could be that time of the...

441
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:29,148
If you say "time of the month,"

442
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:32,718
I'm going to sign you up for a
women's health workshop at my OB-GYN.

443
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:33,986
Don't ever say that in
a house full of women.

444
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,656
Ok, ok. Jeez, well, if it's not that

445
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,524
than I don't know what to tell you.

446
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,726
- Ok.
- I'm home!

447
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,795
Hey, put that away. You need
to get changed for Brandon's...

448
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,398
- I just came down here!
- I know.

449
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,468
Go. Now, Jesus. Go!

450
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:50,536
Where is everybody?

451
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:53,639
- Hi!
- Hey.

452
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:57,276
What's wrong? Everything
all right with Callie?

453
00:28:57,311 --> 00:29:00,346
No, I haven't even checked
on her yet. I just walked in.

454
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,550
I just... something's up with the twins.

455
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,154
- Meaning?
- Well, Mariana's pretending to be sick.

456
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:12,358
- Uh-huh, stomach ache? -
And Jesus is all clammed up.

457
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:14,427
He's not saying something.

458
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,162
Oh.

459
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:21,033
Do you think it's about
Ana? Do you think...

460
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:23,169
maybe I'm putting too
much pressure on Mariana?

461
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:26,072
Absolutely not. I think she
has just changed her mind.

462
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:28,141
They're not ready yet. Really, it's ok.

463
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:33,846
You keep me sane.

464
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,752
I don't know how...

465
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:42,989
sane you're going to feel after you
hear what happened at work today.

466
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:45,825
Now that Vasquez is leaving,
you're never going to guess

467
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,660
who Roberts is partnering me up with.

468
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,595
- Who?
- Mike.

469
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,431
Apparently, he asked for me.

470
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,373
Oh please, do not go all non-verbal on me.

471
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,742
- It is not a big deal, honey.
- Hmm.

472
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:06,412
- It's really not. It's...
- Mm.

473
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:10,216
Now who's all clammed up.
Come on, honey. It's Mike.

474
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,519
- It's just Mike.
- It's just Mike.

475
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:26,999
- Hey Mike.
- Hey.

476
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,267
You guys ready?

477
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:31,170
Brandon, your dad's here!

478
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,039
It's time for your competition!

479
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:37,777
He'll be down in a second.
I think he's nervous.

480
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:41,147
Brandon?

481
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,789
So, I hear you and Stef are going
to be back on the beat together.

482
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:52,625
Oh, yeah.

483
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:54,827
Stef says you asked for her.

484
00:30:54,861 --> 00:31:00,499
I did. Look, it was either me or a rookie.

485
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:03,769
I was never comfortable when she
was working with Vasquez, I...

486
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:08,441
Look, I just feel better
knowing I'm around. Ok?

487
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,643
And we got the kids to think about.

488
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,447
- Ok.
- Ok.

489
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,549
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

490
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,253
I mean, as a feminist, I'm totally
offended and everything, but...

491
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,622
as her wife, you know, thanks.

492
00:31:22,656 --> 00:31:25,157
Yeah, just don't tell Stef I said that.

493
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:31,063
God, where's that kid?

494
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,933
Brandon, shake a leg! We're
going to do this thing!

495
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,268
Hey Mike, you clean up nicely.

496
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:37,270
Stef.

497
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,038
Hey, why aren't you changed?

498
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:40,973
- Hey, he's not here.
- What?

499
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,141
Yeah, they didn't walk home with us.

500
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,909
I just thought he was showing her around.

501
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,945
Her who? Her, Callie, her?

502
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,179
Yeah.

503
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:50,149
That's not like him.

504
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:51,917
He knows he has the music thing tonight.

505
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,053
- I know it's not.
- I don't know who this girl is,

506
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:58,758
or why you guys feel like you have to take
in strays like some damn homeless shelter.

507
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:03,629
- Ok.
- So, where the hell are they?

508
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:08,724
He's not answering. I'm going to try Talya.

509
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,893
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

510
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,695
He probably thought we were
going to meet him at the contest.

511
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:14,897
Why don't I just head over
there and check it out?

512
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,667
- Hey, have you seen Brandon?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

513
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,569
I had this app installed
on all of our phones

514
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,704
because that one kept losing his.

515
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:22,348
Ok.

516
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,648
She says the last time she saw him,

517
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,522
he was talking to Callie
after seventh period.

518
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:28,411
Maybe he's right. Maybe
we're just overreacting.

519
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,646
If we're overreacting, what
are they doing in San Ysidro?

520
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,448
What?

521
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,417
- Are they going to Tijuana?
- I'm going to kill him.

522
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:36,252
This is exactly what I was worried about.

523
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:37,453
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

524
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,267
Hey, Brandon and Callie are missing.

525
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,135
What do you mean "missing?"

526
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,972
They never came home from school.

527
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:57,974
Oh, huh.

528
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:01,344
Hey, you didn't take
any of my pills, did you?

529
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:03,403
What? No. Why?

530
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:06,849
Well, Mom just got me a new
bottle, and now they're almost gone.

531
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,885
What are you looking at me for?

532
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,988
- I was just asking.
- Well, ask Brandon or Callie.

533
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:13,990
Excuse me, I've got to go.

534
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,891
Is that how you got all that money?

535
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,793
- You selling my pills?
- No.

536
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:20,863
'Cause I know sure as hell you
didn't get all that money from Mom.

537
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:24,634
Or maybe you did? Maybe we should ask her.

538
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:30,706
Why? Why would you do something so stupid?

539
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:32,441
You could go to jail for that.

540
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,710
What do you need all that money for anyway?

541
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,481
I've been talking to Ana.

542
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:40,716
Ana?

543
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,585
Our... birth mom?

544
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,488
She got back in town last
month. I found her online.

545
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:47,223
You said you didn't want to meet her.

546
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,425
No, I just...

547
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:53,229
I didn't want Stef and Lena sticking
their noses all up in my business, ok?

548
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,231
They wouldn't get it.
Ana needs some money...

549
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,500
You're giving her money? For what? Why?

550
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,469
- See, I knew you wouldn't understand.
- Understand?

551
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:05,141
You want me to understand
that this woman is not our mom?

552
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,343
She left her two kids so she
can run off with a dumb ass

553
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:08,978
and screw who ever she wanted.

554
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,913
She abandoned us. She left us.

555
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:13,249
Well, she came back.

556
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,020
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one.

557
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,383
Jude.

558
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:03,365
Hello? Is anybody home? I need help.

559
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,302
Hang on!

560
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:09,071
Are you deaf or what?

561
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,210
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes sir.

562
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:17,279
I, um, I was looking for the Metro.

563
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:20,883
- The Metro's a few miles from here.
- I got kind of lost.

564
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,184
- You're lost.
- Yeah.

565
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:28,758
All right, man.  You got to
go about six blocks that way...

566
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,793
Whoa, hey! What the
hell are you doing here?

567
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:32,828
- I just want to talk to Jude.
- No! Shut up! No!

568
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:34,864
- No, you get out of this house!
- One second...

569
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,833
- Hey, shut up!
- Ok, look. I am sorry about your car...

570
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:41,604
- No, get out of here!
- Hey, don't touch her!

571
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,539
- I can pay for it!
- Calm down, man.

572
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,641
- Ok, shut up.
- Ok, ok, ok...

573
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,646
Gun!

574
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,716
- Call 911.
- Lena, stay here.

575
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,319
You know what, buddy? Just shut up!

576
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,301
Police, freeze! Freeze!
Get down on your knees now!

577
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,570
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Get down on your knees now!

578
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:16,539
Put the gun down! Put the gun down!

579
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,507
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

580
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,310
- Honey, are you ok?
- Hands on your head!

581
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:24,046
- Don't move!
- Man, this is my house.

582
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,948
Shut up! Shut up!

583
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,861
And who is that?

584
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:15,764
That's her brother, Jude.

585
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,867
Look, I was just trying
to do the right thing, ok.

586
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,668
I'm sorry about the scholarship.

587
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,537
- I know we could've used the it...
- Brandon.

588
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:25,574
I don't care about the
scholarship. That guy had a gun.

589
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,543
Yeah.

590
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:30,312
Get in there.

591
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:42,458
Hey, Skippy.

592
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:45,361
My brother used to have that backpack.

593
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,330
Cool.

594
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:50,132
I would really like you to understand

595
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:54,169
how this, tonight, could've
ended very, very badly.

596
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:59,508
Look, if you want to send me back to juvie,

597
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:05,381
then you just promise me
Jude will be somewhere safe.

598
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,118
You're not disposable, Callie.

599
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,020
You're...

600
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,289
you're not worthless.

601
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:21,830
Come on here, let's go, let's go.

602
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,099
We'll take them home
for now, Bill. It's fine.

603
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,835
It's fine. I will call you tomorrow.

604
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,038
Ok.

605
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,678
Hey.

606
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,013
You know I'm going to kill you,
if your mom doesn't kill you first.

607
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,982
Yeah.

608
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:42,885
I love you, B.

609
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,587
I love you, too.

610
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,660
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:56,665
But you didn't have to come.

612
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,567
Yes, I did.

613
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,606
Mariana?

614
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,245
Hey...

615
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:14,283
Wow.

616
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,254
You're so pretty.

617
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,225
Thanks. So are you.

618
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:31,400
How've you been?

619
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:37,339
Good. Good... back in town.

620
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:43,278
And, uh, you know, I'm just
trying to get back on my feet.

621
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:48,984
So, you got anything for me?

622
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,120
Oh, uh...

623
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:56,959
Here, I hope this helps.

624
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,197
Trust me...

625
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:04,800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

626
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,235
Don't worry about it.

627
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:16,945
So, you probably have
to get back home, huh?

628
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,649
Folks probably wondering where you are.

629
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,686
- My moms.
- What?

630
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,623
My moms will be wondering where I am.

631
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,692
Ok.

632
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,730
Thanks again.

633
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,944
I'm going to make sure this
guy has a terrible night.

634
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:50,712
Yeah, feel free.

635
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,614
And, I'll get a ride back later.

636
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:56,552
- All right.
- I'll... I'll see you at work tomorrow.

637
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,790
I talked to Bill.

638
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:03,892
He's going to make arrangements
to pick up the kids tomorrow.

639
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,694
No, no, no. No.

640
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:08,497
- What does that mean?
- That means that we are not sending these kids

641
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,399
back into that system right now.

642
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:11,567
All right? Not yet.

643
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:14,770
Are you sure? We really
don't have the room.

644
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,841
Then we'll make room.

645
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,410
Ok, we'll make room.

646
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,759
Buckle up!

647
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:40,618
