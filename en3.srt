1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,517
Previously on The Fosters...

2
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:04,028
After talking with Lena, we
are not going to ground you.

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,233
And you should have talked
to me about it first.

4
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:08,837
I... I don't wanna be some
half-ass version of a dad.

5
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,534
Brandon has three parents. Period.

6
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:12,435
Hey. Hey, hey. She said no, man.

7
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,916
So you were looking for
something permanent, for them?

8
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,833
And we want this to be your very
last way station ever, ever, ever.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,570
What's it gonna be, Kelsey?
Where'd you get the drugs?

10
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:23,830
It was me. I did it.

11
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:24,940
Here.

12
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:37,507
Ok. Let's go. Time's up.

13
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,087
Mariana!

14
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,559
My turn.

15
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,722
- Girls take longer.
- No, no, no. But this isn't fair.

16
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,459
- Get out.
- Just gimme a second.

17
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,660
You're not supposed to be on the computer.

18
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:53,431
- If Moms find out they're gonna ream me.
- This sucks.

19
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,499
Yeah, well you shouldn't have been
giving away your freaking pills.

20
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,134
Come on. Let's go.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,338
About time.

22
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:05,009
Yeah. It hasn't been like
15 extra minutes of anything.

23
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:07,044
So. thank you for that. What are you doing?

24
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:08,946
I gotta pee really bad.

25
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,820
What? Jude!

26
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,755
- I thought you were just...
- I'll be really fast! I promise!

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,330
If you wanna borrow something...

28
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:29,283
- Uh, no. It's ok.
- Ok.

29
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:31,435
I just thought you might be sick
of wearing the same three things...

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,791
I'm not gonna steal your earrings.

31
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,694
I mean, what am I gonna
do? Sell them at school?

32
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:58,763
Don't talk about things
you don't understand.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,335
Ok. Well, what don't I understand, Mariana?

34
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,238
I mean you stole your brother's
pills, you sold them at school,

35
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,407
and then you let your
brother take the fall for you.

36
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,208
I never asked him to do that.

37
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:13,244
But you let him.

38
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,089
Buddy, can you do that in the
bathroom like everybody else, please?

39
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:28,692
- Come on.
- What's that?

40
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,628
We are brown baggin' I for a little while.

41
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:32,596
It's better for you. Go spit.

42
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,516
I don't eat cheese.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,802
Since when? You had pizza
like two nights ago...

44
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,787
It's really bad for you.

45
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:42,339
Can I have tuna?

46
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,542
- If you want to make it.
- Mm.

47
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:47,545
All right, everyone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

48
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,181
Where's Brandon?

49
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,382
Cold!

50
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,419
Oops. I guess there's no more hot water.

51

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
akumenang.com

52
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,963
She spends like an extra 15 minutes
in the shower I'm not even kidding.

53
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,348
It's like my turn and they...

54
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,233
Sounds like you guys
need another bathroom...

55
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,969
Or four less kids.

56
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:49,271
I just want some privacy, really.

57
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah, well I don't think my parents

58
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,108
are going out of town again any time soon,

59
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:56,245
so I'm afraid you missed your
chance for privacy, mister.

60
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,030
Well, we can figure it out.

61
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:02,284
How? It's not like we'll be
alone at your place ever again.

62
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,159
Poor guy. How long is he in detention for?

63
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:14,213
- All week.
- Oof. That's rough.

64
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,849
What do you care?

65
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:20,219
I don't. I just feel sorry
for him. What's with you?

66
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:23,338
Nothing, I just...

67
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,340
look, I feel bad enough about it, ok?

68
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:28,110
Ok, but you really don't have to.

69
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:31,080
Think about all the times you
covered for him. He'll be fine.

70
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,949
It's not like he ever pays
attention in class anyway.

71
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,530
Look, Jude seems like a good kid...

72
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:48,631
He is.

73
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,500
But the Parent Board
is all over me on this.

74
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,636
Obviously, we're ok
giving you a little leeway,

75
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,138
but he has to pass the proficiency exam

76
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,140
that the other kids took to get in,

77
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,342
or I'm afraid you're going to
have to send him somewhere else...

78
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:03,212
I can't send him to another school.

79
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:05,164
He would be completely lost.

80
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,982
That's part of the reason
he's so behind right now.

81
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:09,818
Because he hasn't had
anybody to look out for him.

82
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,253
Look, I'm not unsympathetic, Lena...

83
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:15,057
The only sense of security this
kid has in the world is his sister.

84
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,059
Separating them would be terrible for him.

85
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,695
Look, I'm trying to protect you here, too.

86
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:20,946
You know how this works.

87
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,798
Our funding is based on performance.

88
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:27,536
And now I have a new seventh
grader who jumped the wait list,

89
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:31,373
who isn't operating at
even close to grade level.

90
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,377
Is it possible we could
just give him more time?

91
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,212
Before he has to take the exam, I mean?

92
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,348
I know if I just had a little while
to get him caught up I could...

93
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,984
Lena. He passes the exam on Friday,

94
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,185
or he's done at Anchor Beach.

95
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:49,174
Now, he's guilty, insofar
as he did commit the crime,

96
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,945
But he doesn't feel that way
until he actually gets caught.

97
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,766
Ok. I want everyone to write about
guilt in their journals this week.

98
00:05:58,635 --> 00:05:59,868
Wait, write?

99
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,737
Like with a pen? Like longhand?

100
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,440
Yes, like longhand.

101
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:07,409
And don't worry. No one's gonna read it.

102
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,678
It's just for you to get in
the habit of writing every day.

103
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,350
Ok, guys. Seriously, I want you
to write about whatever it is

104
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:18,087
that you feel weird or
ashamed or guilty about.

105
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,356
You'll feel better about it, I promise.

106
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,789
Weak, Foster. Very weak.

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,973
And quit "nudging" me online.

108
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,909
- Hey, meet me tomorrow.
- Meet you? Why?

109
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,545
You're in detention all day, remember?

110
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,681
I'm gonna have Douglas
let me go to the bathroom.

111
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,534
So, two o'clock. I'll meet
you by the lifeguard stand.

112
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,553
I don't know. I have to think about it.

113
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,288
Foster!

114
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,391
What?

115
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,426
I'll see you tomorrow.

116
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,900
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

117
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,969
Talking to Lexi. What's the big deal?

118
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:10,105
No classes, no extra-curricular, no fun.

119
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,041
In school detention and home. Period.

120
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,676
But we've got a game this week.

121
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,678
Not my problem.

122
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,646
Jesus, you gave away your pills.

123
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,582
Do you not understand how serious that is?

124
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,818
This could have been a lot worse.

125
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,427
Use your legs, B. You're
not using your legs.

126
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,631
The twins are both mad because Moms
moved Callie and Jude into their room

127
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,100
and not mine, so like everyone's all...

128
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,135
everyone's all tense all the time.

129
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,172
That's more like it.

130
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:46,241
Nice. You want some water?

131
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,111
Yeah.

132
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:57,052
So, I was thinking,

133
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,988
maybe you might wanna spend
some more time at my place?

134
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,724
Maybe even move in with me.

135
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,728
Why?

136
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,598
Well, you know I mean,
the new kids in the house.

137
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,600
The place is busting at the seams...

138
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:14,470
I only get you the one night a week.

139
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:17,473
You're going be going off
to college before too long...

140
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,391
and I kinda feel like I'm missing out.

141
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:21,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,046
Could be fun. Why not?

143
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,282
Look, you don't have to say anything.

144
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,201
Just think about it and let me know.

145
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,550
You mind?

146
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,054
- What?
- The song. It's annoying.

147
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,892
You're in a good mood tonight...

148
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:51,993
I'm always in a good mood.

149
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:54,028
You're in a really good mood tonight.

150
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,031
Are you...

151
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,801
is there someone you haven't told me about?

152
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,570
What? No.

153
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:06,608
Really? Nothing's going on? Nothing at all?

154
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:10,545
Nothing between you and Lexi?

155
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,348
Not at all.

156
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:15,583
That's not what it looked
like this afternoon.

157
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,286
When? At volleyball?

158
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,121
We were just talking.

159
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,422
I was helping her with her kill.

160
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:24,125
With her kill, really?

161
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:29,264
What can I say, I'm irresistible...

162
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:36,004
Relax. You know I wouldn't date
one of your lame friends anyway.

163
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,106
Right?

164
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,745
So, I won't be able to go
to school with everyone else?

165
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,546
No, no, no. Honey, listen,

166
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:46,814
all we need to do is give you the test,

167
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,850
and once you pass it,
everything's gonna be fine.

168
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,685
If he passes it.

169
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:55,390
Well, yes, but all he needs a 65
or better, and we're good to go.

170
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,326
You can do that, right?

171
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
This isn't fair.

172
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:04,265
No, it's not. But this
is what I want to suggest,

173
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,035
Jude, you and I are going to
spend this week getting you ready,

174
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,003
and that way you will ace it for sure.

175
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,805
Deal?

176
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:16,644
Ok, remember to convert
to a fraction first.

177
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,046
- Good.
- Hey, B.

178
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,714
- Hey.
- Hey.

179
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:22,817
- How were the batting cages?
- Oh, uh, good, you know.

180
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,588
Yeah? What's up?

181
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:33,328
Uh, bud? I think we got
some good work done tonight.

182
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,530
So, why don't you run
upstairs and get ready for bed.

183
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,335
- Night, Bud.
- Night Jude, we'll be up in a minute.

184
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,270
What's up, babe?

185
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:45,106
Uh, um...

186
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:49,077
Uh, Dad kinda...

187
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,946
asked me to move in with him today.

188
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,652
Wow.

189
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,722
Well, he never mentioned anything to me.

190
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:05,326
And I really think that he
should have talked to me first.

191
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,095
Yeah. I guess.

192
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:11,332
Um. All right, well... don't
worry about it. I'll talk to him.

193
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,235
Yeah, ok...

194
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,206
I said, I'd think about it.

195
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,175
Well, there's really
nothing to think about.

196
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,613
I mean, it's not your choice.

197
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,549
It's not really your father's
either, for that matter.

198
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,519
What do you mean, I don't
get a choice? Why not?

199
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:38,526
Because you're, um...

200
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,361
- you're still a kid.
- I'm 16.

201
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,462
Yes, that's exactly my point.

202
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:43,131
You're 16, you're not an adult yet.

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,933
This is bull.

204
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,202
I'm sorry?

205
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:49,904
This is bull. I should get a say in this.

206
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:52,140
Well, you don't.

207
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:54,058
And we are done talking about this.

208
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,977
Oh, right. Ok, we're
done talking about this.

209
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:58,713
Yeah, 'cause that's, that's
your answer for everything.

210
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:00,048
Ok, let's just take a deep breath...

211
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,784
Right, B. Because you're a
prisoner being held captive

212
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:04,652
in this charming Craftsman in Mission Bay.

213
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,654
- Stef...
- What?

214
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:07,855
When did I ever get to choose anything?

215
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,691
Did I get to choose for you to divorce Dad?

216
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,360
Did I get to choose who
I was gonna live with?

217
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:14,228
You were five! Come on.

218
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:17,398
How about choosing if I have two
moms... did I get to choose that?

219
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,170
- That's enough, Brandon.
- Why?

220
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:25,006
Because I'm not doing exactly
what you want me to do?

221
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,108
No, because you're being disrespectful.

222
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,242
Oh, I'm being disrespectful?

223
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,945
How about you have a little
respect for someone else!

224
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,980
You need to stop talking right now.

225
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:34,949
Right, of course I do!
Because that's your answer.

226
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,752
Anytime anyone disagrees
with you, it's stop talking!

227
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,020
Be quiet! Do it my way!

228
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,623
You need to watch yourself, young man.

229
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,692
- Watch this, Mom.
- Brandon!

230
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,360
If you leave this house.

231
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,296
Stef. Stef! Let him go.

232
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,314
He needs to cool down.

233
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,367
And so do you...

234
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:02,110
Are you gonna be up much longer?

235
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:03,311
I can't sleep with the light on.

236
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,893
I'm not just some
selfish bitch, you know...

237
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:21,796
Ok.

238
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:25,433
I didn't sell the pills for me.

239
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,335
It's not like I bought
a new dress or something.

240
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:31,172
Then why'd you do it?

241
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,409
For my birth mom.

242
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,815
Did you hear me?

243
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,590
I'm listening.

244
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,301
Where were you?

245
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:02,236
I went to Aiden's.

246
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:05,106
You don't do that. You don't walk away.

247
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,042
I know, I know. I was just... I'm sorry.

248
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:12,046
I know. I'm sorry, too...

249
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,917
for raising my voice. But
that can't ever happen again.

250
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:19,086
You can get mad at me all you want to,

251
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,955
but you are not allowed to walk away.

252
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,824
It won't happen again. I promise.

253
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:25,626
Ok.

254
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,530
And, and... for the record,

255
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:32,466
I... I love having two moms.

256
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,304
That's good.

257
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:43,311
Um, you really made your point, Brandon.

258
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:48,849
I spoke with Lena and it's up
to you... where you want to live.

259
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:51,752
You can stay here, or you
can move in with your Dad.

260
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:54,855
It's your choice. Just let
us know what you decide.

261
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,960
Well, don't stay up too
long. 'Cause it's late, ok?

262
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:00,928
- Ok.
- All right, love.

263
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:14,609
You're back. That was some fight, man.

264
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,347
You heard that?

265
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,283
We all did. So what happened?

266
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,285
They're letting me decide.

267
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,823
Really? Wow.

268
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:33,060
I mean, moms are gonna
be devastated if you go.

269
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:35,062
And my Dad will be
devastated if I don't go.

270
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:37,932
You wanted to choose.

271
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,737
Good luck with that.

272
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:54,338
I just think, I mean, we're
gonna get a lot more time alone.

273
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:59,043
I just hope my moms don't get too upset.

274
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:00,378
Brandon they'll be fine.

275
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:03,948
Really. You can go visit
them, you know, whenever...

276
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,217
with all those kids in the house
I doubt they'll even notice.

277
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,138
Very good.

278
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:12,857
I thought you'd have a lot of guilt.

279
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:13,991
Good. Very nice.

280
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,797
Lose your pen? Ok.

281
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,500
Nice. Good.

282
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,468
Good.

283
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:31,575
I see some of us are still
wanting for inspiration.

284
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,211
Tell you what, why don't
you and Wyatt come see me

285
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:37,548
after school today and we can see
if we can get those juices flowing.

286
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:40,351
That's not what I meant.

287
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:42,053
You're incorrigible.

288
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,039
Look it up. Every single one of
you should know what that means.

289
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,158
Ok, turn to page 45.

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,802
So, we gonna talk about the
elephant in the car or what?

291
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,038
Not much to say. You wanted
Brandon to have a choice. He does.

292
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,007
You could've told him no.

293
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,610
I tried. It didn't go well.

294
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,781
Hey, can I have a breakfast
burrito, extra salsa, please?

295
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:12,616
- You got it.
- Thank you.

296
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,189
So what, you just gonna be mad at me?

297
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:19,390
I don't know, Mike.

298
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:22,326
Do I wish you had talked
to me about it first? Sure.

299
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,462
Would I have agreed to
let B decide? Probably not.

300
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:27,031
So, maybe this is for the best.

301
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:29,200
But I'll tell you what you blind-side
me with something like this again

302
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:31,852
I'm gonna bury you deep in the desert.

303
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,004
Fair enough.

304
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,173
Sucks being blind-sided, don't it?

305
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:43,914
So, all of this with
Brandon is just payback?

306
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,500
For what? Figuring out
I was gay and leaving?

307
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:47,835
It's a little late for payback, Stef.

308
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,521
I think so. Mike, come on.

309
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:53,391
If you're gonna rehash our
marriage for ten hours a day,

310
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,292
I'm going to ask Roberts for
another partner. Seriously.

311
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,494
Stef, it's not payback...

312
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:02,166
it's regret. It's me growin' up.

313
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,169
I got a kid who's going off on his own.

314
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:07,338
I'm just trying to do something right.

315
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:17,982
Hey.

316
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,988
So, Talya told me the news...

317
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,589
Huh?

318
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,892
You're moving in with your Dad?

319
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:30,728
Yeah.

320
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:34,265
Um, it's not...

321
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:40,070
this might be stupid, but it's
not because of me and Jude, is it?

322
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:44,341
No. No, no, not at all.

323
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,877
Just 'cause I mean, from what I can tell,

324
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:51,115
you seem pretty happy in the house.

325
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:53,884
- Yeah.
- Hot water not withstanding.

326
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,891
I am, I am. I mean, it's my house.

327
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,726
It's where I grew up.

328
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:07,431
So, why are you leaving?

329
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:30,187
Hey, shouldn't you be in class right now?

330
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,223
We are. Drama.

331
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:35,976
Leslie wanted to make sure the
posters went up today, so...

332
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:37,144
How'd you get out of ISS?

333
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,631
Oh, told Douglas that I had to take a leak.

334
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,834
I should probably get back.

335
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,787
- Listen...
- Yeah?

336
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:51,509
Thank you so much, for what you did.

337
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,611
Telling Moms all that.
You didn't have to do that.

338
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:54,778
It's cool.

339
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:59,283
I just wanted to let you
know how much I appreciate it.

340
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,318
You really are the best brother...

341
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,623
Foster! Foster. Hey!

342
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,745
So, what happened? Douglas wouldn't
even let you out to use the bathroom?

343
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,767
Well, then what? I was sitting
there for like half-an-hour.

344
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:51,902
I'm sorry 'bout that.

345
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,805
"Sorry 'bout that?"

346
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:58,775
- That's it?
- I don't...

347
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,494
I don't think this is a good idea.

348
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,295
Why not?

349
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,247
You know why...

350
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,417
'Cause of Mariana?

351
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,554
Do you honestly think
that she's gonna care?

352
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:12,272
I know she is. She told me.

353
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,208
Her brother and her best
friend like each other, so?

354
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:17,227
Most people would see that as a good thing.

355
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,396
Yeah, well, she doesn't.

356
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:26,103
We're just gonna do whatever Mariana wants?

357
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,621
Try using those to write with.

358
00:21:45,623 --> 00:21:48,425
I don't think it's gonna happen, Timothy.

359
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,260
Maybe we're just not writers.

360
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:55,098
Have you ever heard of Joan Didion? No?

361
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:59,202
She's a writer. Tough lady. Kind of a pill.

362
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:02,172
She called writing, "a hostile act."

363
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:05,008
A way of "imposing your will on the world."

364
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:08,045
Now, I don't mean to point fingers, but...

365
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,982
two of the three people in
this room seem a little hostile.

366
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,950
To me, anyway.

367
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:17,687
The thing is, that sort of
writing takes real courage.

368
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:22,359
And you don't strike me as
someone who is afraid of much...

369
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:25,362
Come on. Come on. One line.

370
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:29,232
One thing that's been rattling
around in your head forever.

371
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,501
One thing you feel terrible about.

372
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:34,404
Get it out. Get it down on paper.

373
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:37,374
And see what happens.

374
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:58,595
- Hey, Bud.
- Hey. Ready.

375
00:22:58,629 --> 00:22:59,813
Where we going? The Grill?

376
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,798
No, my place. I thought
I'd cook something tonight.

377
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,417
Seriously?

378
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:05,802
Yeah, seriously. It's not
like I never cooked before.

379
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:08,505
Unless it's pasta? B, I'd be very careful.

380
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:10,524
Seriously, he cooked me a
piece of fish once in 1997,

381
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,509
I can still taste it.

382
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:14,261
I'll have him back by nine.

383
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:24,454
I know.

384
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:10,300
I'm gonna get a snack.
Do you want anything?

385
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:25,048
Oh, hey don't do that.

386
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:26,983
Uh, we'll eat in front of the TV.

387
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,785
I finally got the surround sound hooked up.

388
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:30,053
Ok.

389
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:34,558
Oh and hey... you know, if you move in,

390
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:35,926
we could move that table out of the way,

391
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,863
and you could put your
keyboard and stuff there.

392
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,732
Yeah, yeah, that would be... that's cool.

393
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:45,368
Yeah, I mean, you know if...

394
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:46,570
- Right, yeah, of course.
- No pressure.

395
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:47,737
Yeah.

396
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:56,213
Hey what's... what's this?

397
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:59,349
Oh, that? You like it? I made it.

398
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,051
You made it?

399
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:03,053
Yeah.

400
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,955
That's the ship I was on
when I was in the Navy.

401
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:08,124
Yeah, I remember the name but...

402
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,227
you made this?

403
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:14,163
Good job, Dad.

404
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:21,605
Remember, this is half base times height.

405
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:24,574
I keep forgetting the formulas.

406
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,810
Maybe I'm just not smart enough.

407
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:29,613
Oh, honey. You are plenty smart.

408
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:31,414
And trust me, I know smart.

409
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:33,450
Considering you went to, what?

410
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,552
Six different schools
in the past four years,

411
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:39,089
you're doing really great...

412
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,407
Seven.

413
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,359
Seven different schools.

414
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:51,968
So, you still playing poker?

415
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:53,236
Uh, no.

416
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:57,874
How come? I mean I remember
you used to brag all the time

417
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,910
about milking those guys for beer money...

418
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:03,013
Ah, you know...

419
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,783
you do something for a
while, people get busy then...

420
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:10,553
I don't know. You just let it go.

421
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:12,489
Too bad.

422
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:14,224
It happens, kid..

423
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,596
I gotta get you home.

424
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:27,037
I mean, I can text Mom.
So, we can finish the movie.

425
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:29,072
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

426
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,274
Ok.

427
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:42,552
Hey, I got an idea. Let's play a game.

428
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,787
Why don't you run up and grab everybody

429
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:46,823
and get something out of the game closet?

430
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,234
Hey, Talya. Come on in.

431
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:59,402
Uh, Brandon's not here, though.

432
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,571
Tonight's the night he has
dinner with his Dad, remember?

433
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,340
Oh, shoot. I forgot.

434
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:06,142
That's ok. You're welcome to wait
if you want. He should be here soon.

435
00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:08,244
And we're just about to play
a game, if you'd like to join.

436
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,379
- Yeah, sure.
- Ok.

437
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,398
Why don't you throw that
stuff in Brandon's room.

438
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,334
- Hey, Callie!
- Hey...

439
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:17,053
We're playing a game?

440
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,789
Yes, we are playing a game.

441
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:20,990
All of us?

442
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:23,827
Yes, all of us. We used to do
this all the time, remember?

443
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:24,861
We just got out of the habit,

444
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,663
and I think now that
Callie and Jude are here,

445
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:27,964
it would be fun to start
the tradition again.

446
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,766
I'm sorry, did somebody say, "Game?"

447
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,434
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

448
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:32,635
You better get ready to lose, lady.

449
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,604
She always loses.

450
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:37,707
- See? Fun.
- Fun! Fun for everyone.

451
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:41,511
They're so much fun. I'm really
gonna miss hanging out here.

452
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:44,514
You know, now that Brandon's
moving in with his Dad.

453
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:46,583
Um, have you talked to him lately?

454
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:49,152
'Cause I just don't think that's happening.

455
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,962
- A boomerang?
- A boomerang...

456
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:03,867
- Really, a boomerang?
- A weapon of some sort.

457
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:10,940
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

458
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,742
We just started, We saved room for you.

459
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:14,811
You can be the top hat.

460
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,747
So...

461
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:23,253
I think I'm gonna move in with my Dad.

462
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:31,961
Ok. Cool.

463
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,073
All right. Um, before we get started,

464
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,709
uh, does anybody want anything?

465
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:48,795
I'm gonna get some tea.
Do you want anything?

466
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:50,713
Ok.

467
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,217
- Hey.
- Hey.

468
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:06,352
So, you're really leaving, huh?

469
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:08,221
Yeah.

470
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:10,924
Hey, uh, thanks for letting me use this.

471
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,226
What are you doing?

472
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,095
That wasn't a loaner.

473
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,163
Really?

474
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:19,799
Yeah, no. It's for you.

475
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,702
I don't know what to say.

476
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,937
You don't have to say anything.

477
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,939
Just make sure you play it.

478
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,613
So, I guess you decided you
need more hot water, huh?

479
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,348
Yeah.

480
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:43,223
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah. No worries.

481
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:58,771
So, I'm gonna move the bed to that wall.

482
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:00,757
Get like a couch in here or something.

483
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,076
Just, really make this
place a serious bachelor pad.

484
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:07,614
Settle down. This is still my room.

485
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:09,916
What am I gonna do without you here, man?

486
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,685
It's just gonna be me and a bunch of girls.

487
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
And Jude.

488
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:17,357
Yeah. And Jude.

489
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:21,294
You'll be fine. Just stay out of trouble.

490
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:23,630
Yes, you. Stop giving out all your pills

491
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:25,398
to every cute girl in
school, for one thing.

492
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,338
It wasn't me.

493
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:35,241
- What?
- It was Mariana.

494
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:37,210
You're joking, right?

495
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,946
She wanted to have some money
to give to our birth mom.

496
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,848
What the hell, man. What are you doing?

497
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:45,051
Why would she do that? And why
would you take the blame for her?

498
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:47,954
Mariana asked me to go with
her to tell Moms what she did.

499
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:51,057
She was just about to say something.

500
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,626
I looked over at her face,

501
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,695
just at her stupid, scared face.

502
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:59,499
It looked just like it did when we
moved into our first foster house.

503
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,601
And I couldn't let her do it.

504
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:04,270
I mean, everyone's always
mad at me all the time anyway.

505
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:05,922
So, I figured, what does it matter?

506
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:06,884
But at least it's over.

507
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:10,410
All of this being grounded,
and In-School Suspension...

508
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:13,446
it was totally worth it, now that she
knows what a loser our birth mom is.

509
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,083
I mean, you know some day you're gonna
have to let Mariana fend for herself.

510
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:18,251
I never touched it!

511
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:20,053
Why would you do that?

512
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,854
- Good luck with those two.
- It was moved!

513
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:23,056
No one else has even been in here!

514
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,141
- I never touched it!
- Hey! Enough shouting!

515
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,826
What is going on?

516
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,961
- She read my journal.
- No, I didn't.

517
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:31,848
Well, somebody did. I left it right here

518
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,866
second from the bottom and
when I came back, it was moved.

519
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:36,636
- Well, it wasn't me.
- Mariana, tell me the truth...

520
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,771
I am! I never touched it.

521
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:42,875
Ok, Callie is it possible that it wasn't
really moved? That you just think it was?

522
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,812
Why? Because Perfect Mariana
could never do anything wrong?

523
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:49,282
Yeah, maybe you should get to
know your daughter a bit better.

524
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,217
Wait, what does that mean?

525
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:01,427
You know what? Forget
it. Don't worry about it.

526
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,296
You're probably right.
It was probably my fault.

527
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,031
I just forgot or something, probably.

528
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,972
I can't live with her.

529
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:15,041
Well, you have to. So, figure it out.

530
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:17,777
Why'd you have to get so mad?

531
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,612
Why can't you just get along with her?

532
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,515
- She read my journal.
- What do you care?

533
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,585
- It's just a stupid journal.
- See for yourself.

534
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:32,225
You wrote about Liam?

535
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:26,345
He said he wants a hostile act...

536
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:39,358
Time's up, Jude. You all done?

537
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,832
I'll correct it, and I'll let you know.

538
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:51,771
I only need a 65 and I can stay, right?

539
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:56,809
Yes... listen to me.

540
00:33:56,844 --> 00:34:00,813
Whatever happens, I'm
really proud of you, ok?

541
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,885
Go on, get to class.
I'll come find you later.

542
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,984
What's that noise?

543
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:20,020
Brandon.

544
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,288
Brandon?

545
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:28,062
Playing basketball? Oh, boy.

546
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,063
He hasn't done that since
he failed that final.

547
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,049
I think he's feeling guilty.

548
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,735
- About what? About leaving us?
- About leaving you.

549
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:36,870
Oh, please.

550
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:40,908
Go talk to him, Stef.

551
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:43,610
What am I supposed to say?

552
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:47,714
He wanted a choice, he got
a choice. He made a choice.

553
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:51,318
I'm doing the best I can...

554
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,720
That's not good enough.

555
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:55,222
- What do you mean?
- You don't get to do this.

556
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:58,192
- Do what?
- You don't get to have hurt feelings and pout.

557
00:36:58,226 --> 00:36:59,393
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

558
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:02,496
You have to step up. You
have to go help your son.

559
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,433
You have to put away whatever
it is you might be feeling,

560
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:09,103
and be the better person.

561
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:11,238
'Cause that's what parents do.

562
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:22,616
Oh.

563
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,585
- Lucky.
- Oh, please.

564
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,571
I've been known to shoot a
basketball or two, my friend.

565
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:32,726
You and Dad were such
jocks. What happened to me?

566
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,595
Oh, come on. You got
the more important stuff.

567
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,664
You're funny and smart
and talented as hell.

568
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,733
And more than that, you're kind.

569
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:42,486
And you know who you are.

570
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,406
You know what makes you happy.

571
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:50,210
That's an amazing thing for someone
your age, B. Don't take that lightly.

572
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:56,984
Just do what makes you happy, B, ok?

573
00:37:57,018 --> 00:38:00,187
You do that and I'll be fine, I
promise. That's the way it works.

574
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:03,907
You don't, have to take care
of me or your Dad or Lena.

575
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,160
It's the other way around.

576
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:30,284
I didn't read your journal.

577
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,224
I know you don't believe
me, and that's fine.

578
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:39,259
I mean, why should you?

579
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:42,362
I'm just the latest girl you've
been forced to share a room with.

580
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:46,300
I remember what that was like.

581
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:49,169
Being passed around all the time.

582
00:38:49,237 --> 00:38:51,972
I don't think I ever felt
safe until I got here.

583
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:55,042
It took me a long time to trust anybody.

584
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:58,011
So, I get it.

585
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:02,049
But I didn't read your journal.

586
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:10,858
Yeah, comin'!

587
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:14,828
Hey. What's going on?

588
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:18,432
I thought we weren't
moving you in till tomorrow?

589
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:22,736
Um, yeah, um... about that.

590
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,541
You ok?

591
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:33,113
Yeah... I just. I, uh, I can't...

592
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,117
You can't what?

593
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:41,121
Move in with you.

594
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,792
Ok.

595
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:48,061
I just, I'm sorry.

596
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:50,964
It's ok!

597
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:58,038
I just, I can't leave
Mom... and everybody else.

598
00:39:58,072 --> 00:40:00,707
Don't worry about it.

599
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:04,478
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

600
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:08,782
Look, listen... this was never
supposed to be a bad thing.

601
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:14,388
You do what you gotta do.
I'm gonna be all right.

602
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,657
I mean it.

603
00:40:18,393 --> 00:40:19,526
Ok?

604
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,439
Is that a, uh...

605
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,207
is it a piano?

606
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:37,444
Oh yeah, yeah. I rented it.

607
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:43,050
But it's fine. You can
come play whenever you want.

608
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,459
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,975
Oh, about time.

610
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:11,962
Sorry my parents wouldn't let me come.

611
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:22,222
- Hurry up. We've been waiting forever.
- Ok, we were making popcorn.

612
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,057
Unless, of course, you don't want any?

613
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,326
I don't think they want any.
We'll just have this for us.

614
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,028
- I'll take some.
- Come on...

615
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:30,931
- All right, ask nicely.
- Pass that down.

616
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:33,166
Here we go, here we go...

617
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,185
- This is ours.
- Jude?

618
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:37,938
Pass it down, pass it down...

619
00:41:40,024 --> 00:41:42,376
- What you working on?
- English homework.

620
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,211
I have to write a story,

621
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,279
and I need a name for the bad guy.

622
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:48,382
You know we busted this dealer.

623
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,350
Uh, his name... really bad
guy. His name was Freddy.

624
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:53,286
- That's a good name.
- What about Sanchez?

625
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:56,957
Like your boss? No, no, no.
Jude, you cannot use that.

626
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,993
Does it have to be a
boy? Or can it be a girl?

627
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,294
How about Liam?

628
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,170
Hear one you like?

629
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:15,042
Good. All right, Lena.
Back in your seat. Let's go.

630
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:18,345
No talking. Anybody.
Quiet. I've killed for less.

631
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,313
Talking during the movie.
